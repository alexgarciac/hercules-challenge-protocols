e100,Scratch Wound Healing Assay,"The scratch wound healing assay has been widely adapted and modified to study the effects of a variety of experimental conditions, for instance, gene knockdown or chemical exposure, on mammalian cell migration and proliferation. In a typical scratch wound healing assay, a “wound gap” in a cell monolayer is created by scratching, and the “healing” of this gap by cell migration and growth towards the center of the gap is monitored and often quantitated.  Factors that alter the motility and/or growth of the cells can lead to increased or decreased rate of “healing” of the gap (Lampugnani, 1999). This assay is simple, inexpensive, and experimental conditions can be easily adjusted for different purposes. The assay can also be used for a high-throughput screen platform if an automated system is used (Yarrow and Perlman, 2004).","Scratch Wound Healing Assay.

ADCC has been found to be a main route of immune protection against viral infections and cancers in vivo. Here we developed a flow cytometry based protocol for ADCC assay using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells. Using this protocol, we determined the ADCC activity of convalescent plasma IgGs from six H1N1-infected human subjects in China, and identified two dominant ADCC epitopes, designated E1 [amino acid (AA) 92-117] and E2 (AA 124-159), on haemagglutinin of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus by epitope mapping of the convalescent plasma IgGs with different levels of ADCC activity.

e1072,Catalase Activity Assay in Candida glabrata,"Commensal and pathogenic fungi are exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by macrophages of the host. Pathogenic fungi counteract the harmful effects of H2O2 with the enzyme catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), which decomposes two molecules of H2O2 to two molecules of H2O and O2. Contribution of antioxidant systems on fungal virulence is actively studied. Measurement of catalase activity can contribute to the elucidation of the factors that influence the regulation of this pivotal enzyme. Here we describe a simple spectrophotometric method in which the activity of catalase is measured in total yeast extracts.

With northern blotting it is possible to observe particular gene expression levels during differentiation, morphogenesis, as well as abnormal or diseased conditions. Here, we examine ATF3, ATF4, and GADD153 gene expression profiles by northern blot in Vero cells and H1299 cells after IBV infection.  RNA was extracted in IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) infected cells and electrophoresis was used to separate the RNA sample.

e1090,Flow Cytometric Analysis of Autophagic Activity with Cyto-ID Staining in Primary Cells,"Flow cytometry allows very sensitive and reliable high-throughput analysis of autophagic flux. This methodology permits to screen cells in flow and capture multi-component images. Using this technology autophagic flux may be analysed accurately in both suspension as well as adherent cells upon trypsinization independent of how heterogeneous the autophagosomal content might be. The method is based on Cyto-ID staining of autophagic compartments (pre-autophagosomes, autophagosomes, and autophagolysosomes) in live cells using Cyto-ID® Autophagy Detection Kit. Autophagic compartments are intermediate constituents of a dynamic lysosomal degradation process and their intracellular abundance at a particular time point is a function of the established equilibrium between their generation and degradation. Determination of autophagic flux facilitates the discrimination between early induction of autophagosome formation and late inhibition of autophagosome maturation as both results in an ultimate increase in autophagosomal presence. Cyto-ID assay is based on the usage of a specific dye that selectively stains autophagic compartments and therefore allows determination of autophagic flux as accumulation of stained compartments in basic or activated conditions [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L) or Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 6 mmol/L glucose (starvation medium)] after blockage of autophagolysosomal degradation using  lysosomotropic compounds such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10-20 mmol/L) or chloroquine (CQ) (5-10 µmol/L).

e1136,Preparation of Parasite Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis,"In order to prepare protein extracts of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages for western blot analysis, infected red blood cells (iRBC) need to be separated from uninfected red blood cells (uRBC) which make up the bulk of the parasite culture. Depending on the localisation of the parasite protein of interest, different methods are available to achieve this. If the protein is present within the parasite or is attached to a cellular structure of the iRBC cell, saponin can be used. This reagent lyses the membranes of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, the Maurer´s clefts (vesicular structures in the iRBC) and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane containing the parasite but leaves the parasite plasma membrane intact, providing a convenient procedure to isolate intact parasites without uRBCs. However, this method has the disadvantage that the host cell cytosol and the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) content of iRBCs are lost. If this has to be avoided, it is possible to use a Percoll gradient to separate intact iRBCs from uRBCs. Sequential treatment with Tetanolysin and saponin can then be used to selectively release the iRBC cytosol and the PV content from the parasite. These selective lysis methods are also suitable to determine the subcellular localisation of a protein of interest.","Preparation of Parasite Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis.

Resuspend the pellet in 50 µl 1x pbs, add 50 µl saponin lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min. Three possible results after centrifugation are shown under 'outcomes' (top right): 1) one band consisting of mostly debris, merozoites and segmented schizonts at the border between the 40% percoll and the aqueous region (present above the 40% percoll after centrifugation) and one band above urbc/ring stage region consisting of younger schizonts and trophozoites (this is the fraction to harvest.); 2) similar appearance to 1) but with multiple bands below the debris/merozoites/segmented schizonts phase; these bands usually consist of different stages of irbcs and can all be collected; 3) no clearly defined band; in this case collect the indicated fraction (from the mid 40% to the region just above the urbcs and ring stage phase, making sure not to disturb this phase).

e1471,Murine Liver Myeloid Cell Isolation Protocol,"In homeostasis, the liver is critical for the metabolism of nutrients including sugars, lipids, proteins and iron, for the clearance of toxins, and to induce immune tolerance to gut-derived antigens. These functions predispose the liver to infection by blood-borne pathogens, and to a variety of diseases ranging from toxin and medication-induced disorders (CCl4, acetaminophen) to metabolic disorders (steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, biliary obstruction, cholestasis) or autoimmunity. Chronic liver injury often progresses to life threatening fibrosis and can end in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Pellicoro et al., 2014).   The liver contains parenchymal cells or hepatocytes that make up the majority of hepatic cells. It also contains non-parenchymal structural cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells and a large number of non-parenchymal innate immune cells, mainly monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, DCs, NK and NKT cells that can trigger an adaptive immune response in the case of infections or other pathogenic insults (Jenne and Kubes, 2013). How this immune response is regulated determines the extent of acute and chronic liver injury (Stijlemans et al., 2014). In this context, liver macrophages have been demonstrated to play central but divergent (from initiating to resolving) functions in liver injury (Sica et al., 2014). It has become clear in the last years that hepatic macrophages consist of two classes, tissue-resident macrophages, the Kupffer cells (KCs) originating from yolk sac/fetal liver progenitors and tissue-infiltrating macrophages originating from bone marrow-derived Ly6CHi monocytes (Jinhoux and Jung, 2014; Tacke and Zimmerman, 2014). Distinguishing the activities of KCs from those of monocyte-derived macrophages during liver injury or repair is currently a frontline research topic in the macrophage field. Indeed, considering that clinical management of liver failure remains problematic, a better understanding of the immune mechanisms regulating liver injury is expected to allow the development of new therapeutic modalities.

e1569,Isolation of Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities from Soil,"Rhizosphere bacterial communities have become a major focal point of research in recent years, especially regarding how they affect plants and vice versa (Philippot et al., 2013).  Changes in microbial density and diversity within the rhizosphere occur in a spatial temporal manner. The soil zone closest to the plant roots has the most density and diversity of microbes (Clark, 1940). The lack of methods to consistently isolate rhizosphere samples in a spatially defined manner is a major bottleneck in rhizosphere microbiology. We hypothesized that microbes with increasing affinities to and distance from the plant root can be isolated using increasing strengths of physical disruption. Sonication is an excellent choice due to the ability to gently remove rhizosphere soil and bacterial biofilms without damaging plant roots (Doi T et al., 2007; Bulgarelli et al., 2012; Lundberg et al., 2012). In addition, simply increasing the time of sonication can increase the amount of physical force. We used such an approach to consistently isolate microbial communities with different affinities to the soybean roots (White et al., 2014). This article describes the use of successive sonication to isolate distal, middle, and proximal soil from the rhizosphere of soybean roots.","Sow plant seeds or plant seedlings into soil of interest and allow seeds/seedlings to grow for desired amount of time (minimum of 1 week suggested for soybean plants) Submerge the roots in a still pool of dH2O and gently shake the roots (as if painting a picture or dunking a teabag) to remove larger soil particles.

Here we describe a detailed protocol for isolation of bacterial communities from the plant roots. The number of bacterial colonies in the Rhizosphere is a critical factor in determining the diversity of bacterial species present in the region."," Rhizosphere bacterial communities can be isolated from the rhizosphere by the isolation of bacterial communities from the soil. This protocol describes the root system, based on the specific type of bacterial community that can be distinguished from the plant root.","Notes: this sonication yields the rhizosphere soil furthest from the plant root or soil with least affinity to the plant root, noted as the “distal soil” sample. Soybean roots submerged in 10 ml of pbst within a 15 ml centrifuge tube firmly secure the centrifuge tube lids, then place the tubes in a floating raft within a sonicator filled with dh2o. Using tweezers, gently remove the root(s) from the current centrifuge tube(s) and either discard the roots or place them into a new, labeled centrifuge tube (or tubes) filled with fresh pbst, then store the tubes at 4 °c until needed.

e1797,Preparation and Immunofluorescence Staining of the Trachea in Drosophila Larvae and Pupae,"The Drosophila melanogaster trachea is a branched network of rigid chitin-lined tubes that ramify throughout the body and functions as the fly’s respiratory organ. Small openings at the ends of the tracheal tubes allow gas exchange to occur by diffusion between internal tissues and the exterior environment. Tracheal tubes are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, which secrete chitin and control tube morphology and size. Studies of tracheal development in Drosophila embryos have elucidated fundamental mechanisms of tube morphogenesis and maintenance in vivo, and identified major signaling pathways that regulate these processes (Manning and Krasnow, 1993; Affolter and Shilo, 2000; Zuo et al., 2013; Kerman et al., 2006; Schottenfeld et al., 2010).  In recent years, there has been growing interest in the trachea during metamorphosis, when tracheal branches that had served as the respiratory organ in the larva decays and is repaired or replaced by new tracheal tissue arising from committed tracheal progenitor cells, or mature tracheal cells de-differentiated to a progenitor state (Manning and Krasnow, 1993; Sato and Kornberg, 2002; Guha et al., 2008; Guha, and Kornberg, 2005; Weaver and Krasnow, 2008; Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2010; Chen and Krasnow, 2014) forming the adult tracheal by the end of the process. The ongoing decay and tissue formation models aspects of tissue repair and regeneration in other organisms, and has been used to understand how progenitor cells divide and differentiate (Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2010; Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2013), and how they grow out of their niche to replace decaying tissue (Chen and Krasnow, 2014). Here, we present a protocol to dissect, fix, and immunostain tracheal tissue in Drosophila larvae and pupae undergoing metamorphosis. This protocol can be used to immunostain proteins expressed in tracheal tissue, or to amplify signals from weakly expressed fluorescent reporters (as shown in Figure 6). With the appropriate antibodies and genetic reporters, this protocol can be used to visualize decaying larval trachea and the progenitor cells that replace them in a time-course analysis, as well as determine expression of proteins in these cells that may play a role in tissue decay and replacement.","The staging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae and pupae is described in (Ashburner, 2005) Young larvae will burrow into the food as they feed. Tracheal progenitors are activated during the late second-instar (L2) stage and remodel the trachea."," The staging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae and pupae is described in (Ashburner, 2005) for more information on larval staging.

e186,Analysis of Mouse Liver Glycogen Content,"Liver is the major site for glycogen storage.  Glycogen content can be significantly altered upon disruption of glucose homeostasis in metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes.  Glycogen content can be determined by an acid-hydrolysis method (Passonneau and Lauderdale, 1974). Basically, glucose, the hydrolysis product of glycogen, is converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by hexokinase in the presence of ATP.  With the supply of NADP, G-6-P is further converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid by G-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), while production of NADPH can be measured spectrophotometrically.  Our lab has used this method to demonstrate that liver glycogen levels are significantly elevated in diabetic Perk knockout mice (Zhang et al., 2002).","Liver sample preparation Sacrifice non-fasted animals and isolate liver slices.

e247,Senescence Associated β-galactosidase Staining,"Detection of senescent cells using a cytochemical assay was first described in 1995 (Dimri et al., 1995). The identification of senescent cells is based on an increased level of lysosomal β-galactosidase activity (Kurz et al., 2000). Cells under normal growth condition produce acid lysosomal β- galactosidase, which is localized in the lysosome. The enzymatic activity can be detected at the optimal pH 4.0, using the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Miller, 1972). In comparison, upon senescence, the lysosomal mass is increased, leading to production of a higher level of β-galactosidase, termed senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) (Kurz et al., 2000). The abundant senescence-associated enzyme is detectable over background despite the less favorable pH conditions (pH 6.0) (Dimri et al., 1995). The SA-β gal positive cells stain blue-green, which can be scored under bright-field microscopy. In this assay it is best to avoid over-confluency of the cells, or cells that have undergone too many passages, as these conditions can cause false positive results.","The manipulation of cells for the SA-β-gal staining assay may be performed in a 24-well plate format.

e251,Ribosome Fractionation in Yeast,"This protocol describes yeast ribosome fractionation in the gradient of sucrose. During the cyclic process of translation, a small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunit associate with mRNA to form an 80S complex (monosome). This ribosome moves along the mRNA during translational elongation, and then dissociates into the 40S and 60S subunits on termination. During elongation by one ribosome, further ribosomes can initiate translation on the same mRNA to form polysomes. The mass of each polysomal complex is determined primarily by the number of ribosomes it contains. Hence, the population of polysomes within the cell can be size-fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation on the basis of the loading of ribosomes on the mRNA. Several compounds help to maintain or to disrupt the polysomes (Figure 1).","Ribosome Fractionation in Yeast. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media.

e3089,"Use of Gas Chromatography to Quantify Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Serum, Colonic Luminal Content and Feces of Mice","Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) are a product of the fermentation of resistant starches and dietary fibers by the gut microbiota. The most important SCFA are acetate (C2), propionate (C3) and butyrate (C4). These metabolites are formed and absorbed in the colon and then transported through the hepatic vein to the liver. SCFAs are more concentrated in the intestinal lumen than in the serum. Butyrate is largely consumed in the gut epithelium, propionate in the liver and acetate in the periphery. SCFAs act on many cells including components of the immune system and epithelial cells by two main mechanisms: activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylase. Considering the association between changes in SCFA concentrations and the development of diseases, methods to quantify these acids in different biological samples are important. In this study, we describe a protocol using gas chromatography to quantify SCFAs in the serum, feces and colonic luminal content. Separation of compounds was performed using a DB-23 column (60 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter [i.d.]) coated with a 0.15 µm thick layer of 80.2% 1-methylnaphatalene.

e313,Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (CM-H2DCFDA),"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cellular physiopathology. ROS are implicated in cell proliferation, signaling pathways, oxidative defense mechanisms responsible for killing of bacteria, thyroid hormonosynthesis, etc. The cellular Redox homeostasis is balanced by oxidants and antioxidants systems. In several diseases (cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases), the Redox balance is disturbed. In fact, excessive amounts of ROS can damage proteins, lipids and DNA at cellular level. The choose of a sensitive method for detection of intracellular ROS is very important for detecting the disturbed Redox balance in pathological cells and after exposition of cells to different genotoxic agents (Irradiation, Oxidative stress, etc).The detection of ROS in biological systems is difficult for several reasons: Method sensibility and probe specificity. The 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) fluorescent probe is commonly employed and may react with several ROS including hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. The cell-permeant H2DCFDA passively diffuses into cells and is retained in the intracellular level after cleavage by intracellular esterases. Upon oxidation by ROS, the nonfluorescent H2DCFDA is converted to the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The chloromethyl derivative of H2DCFDA (CM-H2DCFDA) provides much better retention in live cells than H2DCFDA. Dead or dying cells produces ROS. When we want to detect ROS in living cells, we have to stain cells by propidium iodide (PI) and evaluate ROS production only in living cells which are PI negative. In fact, PI intercalates into double-stranded nucleic acids. It is excluded by viable cells but can penetrate cell membranes of dying or dead cells. PI is excited at 488 nm and emits at a maximum wavelength of 617 nm. Because of these spectral characteristics, PI can be used in combination with other fluorescent probe such as CM-H2DCFDA (excitation/emission: 492–495/517–527 nm).A probe fluorescence emission can be assessed by Flow cytometry, a standard fluorometer or fluorescence microscopy using appropriate filter.Flow cytometry is commonly employed to detect intracellular ROS production. Flow cytometry measures fluorescence per cell. The cells is excited by the light source and emitted light from cells are converted to electrical pulses by optical detectors. Emitted Light is send to different detectors by using optical filters: 525 nm Band Pass Filter for FL-1 and 620 nm Band Pass Filter for FL-3. A 525 nm band pass filter (FL-1) placed in the light path prior to the detector will only allow “green” light into the detector. So, FL-1 is used in our protocol to collect green light corresponding to the oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) by ROS. FL-1 is the Green (FL-1) channel on flow cytometers. 620 nm Band Pass Filter (FL-3) only allow “red” light into the detector. Red fluorescence emission is measured in the Red (FL-3) channel on most flow cytometers.","HTori-3.1 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well into six-well plates in complete culture medium.

e3355,"PEG-mediated, Stable, Nuclear and Chloroplast Transformation of Cyanidioschizon merolae","The ability to achieve nuclear or chloroplast transformation in plants has been a long standing goal, especially in microalgae research. Over past years there has been only little success, but transient and stable nuclear transformation has been achieved in multiple species. Our newly developed method allows for relatively simple transformation of Cyanidioschizon merolae in both nuclear and chloroplast genome by means of homologous recombination between the genome and a transformation vector. The use of chloramphenicol resistance gene as the selectable marker allows for plate-based efficient selection of mutant colonies. Overall, the method allows the generation of mutant strains within 6 months.","Cyanidioschizon merolae is a single-cellukaryotic red algae that inhabits hot springs. All three of its genomes were sequenced, all three of the genomes were. sequenced: nucleus (Matsatsaki al., 2004), mitochondrion (Ohta et al., 1998), and plastid (Blott and Blott, 2003) The entire procedure for the entire procedure may vary and typically takes about 6 months.

e3382,ATAC-seq on Sorted Adult Mouse Neurons,"Transcription regulation is a key aspect of cellular identity established during development and maintained into adulthood. Molecular and biochemical assays that probe the genome are critical tools in exploring mechanisms of transcription regulation and cell type identity. The mammalian brain is composed of a huge diversity of cell types with distinct properties and functions. To understand these specific roles, it is necessary to selectively target cell populations for study. However, the need to selectively study restricted cell populations poses a challenge in neurobiology. It is often difficult to collect sufficient cellular input for many standard biochemical and molecular assays. Recently, important advances have been made to scale assays down, opening up new frontiers to explore molecular mechanisms in neurons. Concurrently, methodologies for preparing neurons for such assays has advanced taking into consideration specific methods to preserve the cell biology meant to be assayed. Here we describe a method for preparing live neurons from adult brain tissue for the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC).",ATAC-seq is becoming a widely used method to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility. This allows chromatin and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to be explored in previously inaccessible populations of rare or sparse cell types.

A major advantage is that it can produce high-quality data from significantly smaller input. This allows chromatin and transcription regulatory mechanisms to be explored in previously inaccessible populations of rare or sparse cell types. This is particularly useful in the nervous system where cellular diversity is incredibly high and cells of interest are post-mitotic", Sorted adult mice have a genome-wide chromatin accessibility assay (ATAC-seq) that can be used to study a diverse range of cell types in the nervous system.,"Pause point: amplified dna can be stored at -20 °c. quality assessment (2-3 h).. the assay for transposase accessible chromatin coupled with next generation sequencing (atac-seq) is becoming a widely used method to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility (buenrostro et al., 2013; corces et al., 2017).

e3386,3D Organoid Formation from the Murine Salivary Gland Cell Line SIMS,"Salivary glands consist of multiple phenotypically and functionally unique cell populations, such as the acinar, ductal, and myoepithelial cells that help produce, modify, and secrete saliva (Lombaert et al., 2011). Identification of mechanisms and factors that regulate these populations has been of key interest, as salivary gland-related diseases have detrimental effects on these cell populations. A variety of approaches have been used to understand the roles different signaling mechanisms and transcription factors play in regulating salivary gland development and homeostasis. Differentiation assays have been performed with primary salivary cells in the past (Maimets et al., 2016), however this approach may sometimes be limiting due to tissue availability, labor intensity of processing the tissue samples, and/or inability to long-term passage the cells. Here we describe in detail a 3D differentiation assay to analyze the differentiation potential of a salivary gland cell line, SIMS, which was immortalized from an adult mouse submandibular salivary gland (Laoide et al., 1996). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found in vivo to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure et al., 2015; Song et al. 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells in vivo, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific in vitro controlled conditions.","3D Organoid Formation from the Murine Salivary Gland Cell Line SIMS.

e3387,Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide Perfusion Blocks Gene Expression of Synaptic Plasticity-related Proteins without Inducing Compensation in Hippocampal Slices,"The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity has been hindered by both the compensation that can occur after chronic loss of the core plasticity molecules and by ex vivo conditions that may not reproduce in vivo plasticity. Here we describe a novel method to rapidly suppress gene expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) applied to rodent brain slices in an “Oslo-type” interface chamber. The method has three advantageous features: 1) rapid blockade of new synthesis of the targeted proteins that avoids genetic compensation, 2) efficient oxygenation of the brain slice, which is critical for reproducing in vivo conditions of long-term synaptic plasticity, and 3) a recirculation system that uses only small volumes of bath solution (< 5 ml), reducing the amount of reagents required for long-term experiments lasting many hours. The method employs a custom-made recirculation system involving piezoelectric micropumps and was first used for the acute translational blockade of protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) synthesis during long-term potentiation (LTP) by Tsokas et al., 2016. In that study, applying antisense-ODN rapidly prevents the synthesis of PKMζ and blocks late-LTP without inducing the compensation by other protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that occurs in PKCζ/PKMζ knockout mice. In addition, we show that in a low-oxygenation submersion-type chamber, applications of the atypical PKC inhibitor, zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) can result in unstable baseline synaptic transmission, but in the high-oxygenation, ""Oslo-type"" interface electrophysiology chamber, the drug reverses late-LTP without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. This comparison reveals that the interface chamber, but not the submersion chamber, reproduces the effects of ZIP in vivo. Therefore, the protocol combines the ability to acutely block new synthesis of specific proteins for the study of long-term synaptic plasticity, while maintaining properties of synaptic transmission that reproduce in vivo conditions relevant for long-term memory.","To fit all the necessary components, a breadboard with 3 terminal strips and 63 rows of 10 tie points per terminal strip is required.

Sociability is defined as the tendency of the experimental mouse to spend more time exploring an unfamiliar mouse than exploring an object or an empty chamber.

Here, we describe a protocol of an AD-like pathology of the sporadic form using Wistar rats by a single bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 2 mg/kg). Icv injection of STZ induces brain resistance to insulin and other pathological alterations related to those observed in AD, such as cognitive impairment and accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein and β-amyloid in the brain.

e3402,"Visualization of Nitric Oxide, Measurement of Nitrosothiols Content, Activity of NOS and NR in Wheat Seedlings","Nitric oxide (NO), is a redox-active, endogenous signalling molecule involved in the regulation of numerous processes. It plays a crucial role in adaptation and tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. In higher plants, NO is produced either by enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitrite and an oxidative pathway requiring a putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme. There are several methods to measure NO production: mass spectrometry, tissue localization by DAF-FM dye. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) also known as electron spin resonance (ESR) and spectrophotometric assays. The activity of NOS can be measured by L-citrulline based assay and spectroscopic method (NADPH utilization method). A major route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This experimental method describes visualization of NO using DAF-FM dye by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss AXIOSKOP 2).

Hypothalamic neurons that govern feeding are responsive to sensory cues associated with food, including food odors. However, the circuit mechanisms by which sensory information is processed and relayed to feeding nodes to affect feeding behavior is not well understood. Recent work has identified a population of excitatory basal forebrain neurons that modulate potent appetite suppression, as well as respond to food-associated and innately aversive odorants. To investigate this circuitry, we stereotaxically targeted virus expressing Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin to the basal forebrain and implanted fiber optic cannulas over the injection site. Mice were allowed to recover and underwent training to form a passive association of chow with a unique monomolecular odorant. After training, mice were fasted overnight, and were then presented with both the food-associated odor as well as a similar, novel odor in zones of an arena with and without photostimulation. To evaluate whether stimulation of this circuitry influenced sensory modulation of feeding behavior, video recording and behavioral tracking analysis were used to compare time spent investigating either odor. Thus, this protocol provides a useful paradigm to assay the contribution of different circuits in appetitive and aversive behaviors.","Fiber optic creation (Figures 1A and 1B) Cut ~4-5 inches of the optic fiber, providing you with ample material to work with for your implant.

e3407,Probabilistic Models for Predicting Mutational Routes to New Adaptive Phenotypes,"Understanding the translation of genetic variation to phenotypic variation is a fundamental problem in genetics and evolutionary biology. The introduction of new genetic variation through mutation can lead to new adaptive phenotypes, but the complexity of the genotype-to-phenotype map makes it challenging to predict the phenotypic effects of mutation. Metabolic models, in conjunction with flux balance analysis, have been used to predict evolutionary optimality. These methods however rely on large scale models of metabolism, describe a limited set of phenotypes, and assume that selection for growth rate is the prime evolutionary driver. Here we describe a method for computing the relative likelihood that mutational change will translate into a phenotypic change between two molecular pathways. The interactions of molecular components in the pathways are modeled with ordinary differential equations. Unknown parameters are offset by probability distributions that describe the concentrations of molecular components, the reaction rates for different molecular processes, and the effects of mutations. Finally, the likelihood that mutations in a pathway will yield phenotypic change is estimated with stochastic simulations.One advantage of this method is that only basic knowledge of the interaction network underlying a phenotype is required. However, it can also incorporate available information about concentrations and reaction rates as well as mutational biases and mutational robustness of molecular components. The method estimates the relative probabilities that different pathways produce phenotypic change, which can be combined with fitness models to predict evolutionary outcomes.",Probabilistic Models for Predicting Mutational Routes to New Adaptive Phenotypes.

Here we describe a mathematical model that describes the molecular pathway’s reaction kinetics. This method can be used to determine the mechanisms of mutations that alter the internal dynamics of a given pathway. In general, it is possible that all pieces of information are known for a model in which case there will be only one numerical solution for each pathway model.", Probabilistic models of molecular pathways that determine the expression of new adaptive phenotypic phenotypes are based on the kinetics of a particular phenotype. This protocol describes the molecular pathway that can be adapted to a new adaptive phenotype.,"“run model comparison” use the procedure “phenotype change” for each pathway to compute the probability that mutation in a pathway causes a phenotypic change. We assume that the relevant mutations to a pathway are those that alter reaction rates, i.e., change the internal dynamics of a pathway, and we classify mutations as enabling or disabling based on whether they increase/decrease reaction rates. For example, in (lind et al., 2019) enabling mutations were assumed to affect reaction rates multiplicatively and thus new reaction rates were computed as the product of the original reaction rate and a multiplicative factor sampled from 10u[0,2] (similarly a factor of 10u[−2,0]) was used for disabling mutations. Information about mutational biases (lind et al., 2019) and the molecular effects of mutations on protein function from different prediction methods (capriotti et al., 2005; bromberg and rost, 2007; kumar et al., 2009; dehouck et al., 2011; capriotti et al., 2013; celniker et al., 2013; yates et al., 2014; choi and chan, 2015) can be incorporated into the model described here to adjust the rates of disabling and enabling mutation in different genes."

e3424,SarkoSpin: A Technique for Biochemical Isolation and Characterization  of Pathological TDP-43 Aggregates,"TDP-43 is the main aggregating protein in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Aggregated TDP-43 is resistant to diverse detergent solubilization, yet physiological TDP-43 and other abundant proteins commonly co-purify with pathological TDP-43. This mixed isolation has precluded the elucidation of the biochemical and structural features of the pathological TDP-43 and its role in disease. Here we describe SarkoSpin, a method for the isolation of pure pathological TDP-43 from patient autopsy brain by sample solubilization with Sarkosyl after nuclease treatment. This purification, which is also applicable to cell culture material, permits the study of biochemical properties of exclusively pathological TDP-43, allowing for the first time the determination of their link to the clinical presentation of FTLD.

e3427,Isolation and Quantification of Metabolite Levels in Murine Tumor Interstitial Fluid by LC/MS,"Cancer is a disease characterized by altered metabolism, and there has been renewed interest in understanding the metabolism of tumors. Even though nutrient availability is a critical determinant of tumor metabolism, there has been little systematic study of the nutrients directly available to cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Previous work characterizing the metabolites present in the tumor interstitial fluid has been restricted to the measurement of a small number of nutrients such as glucose and lactate in a limited number of samples. Here we adapt a centrifugation-based method of tumor interstitial fluid isolation readily applicable to a number of sample types and a mass spectrometry-based method for the absolute quantitation of many metabolites in interstitial fluid samples. In this method, tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) is analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using both isotope dilution and external standard calibration to derive absolute concentrations of targeted metabolites present in interstitial fluid. The use of isotope dilution allows for accurate absolute quantitation of metabolites, as other methods of quantitation are inadequate for determining nutrient concentrations in biological fluids due to matrix effects that alter the apparent concentration of metabolites depending on the composition of the fluid in which they are contained. This method therefore can be applied to measure the absolute concentrations of many metabolites in interstitial fluid from diverse tumor types, as well as most other biological fluids, allowing for characterization of nutrient levels in the microenvironment of solid tumors.","The number of biological replicates needed for studies will depend on the variability between samples.

This approach provides a robust method to quantitate polar metabolites in biological fluids and complements similar existing isotope dilution based methods, such as the commercially available biocrates absoluteidq kits (gieger et al., 2008) that primarily quantify non-polar lipids in biological samples.the absolute quantitation of metabolite levels enabled by this protocol can allow for direct comparison of interstitial fluid composition in diverse tumor types, providing the opportunity to systematically interrogate nutrient availability in animal models of diverse cancers and human tumor samples.

e3433,Labeling and Isolation of Fluorouracil Tagged RNA by Cytosine Deaminase Expression,"Tissues are comprised of different cell types whose interactions elicit distinct gene expression patterns that regulate tissue formation, regeneration, homeostasis and repair. Analysis of these gene expression patterns require methods that can capture as closely as possible the transcriptomes of cells of interest in their tissue microenvironment.

e3435,Determination of Chromatin Accessibility in Drosophila Midgut Enterocytes by in situ 5mC Labeling,"Regulation of gene expression involves dynamic changes in chromatin organization, where in many cases open chromatin structure correlates with gene activation. Several methods enable monitoring changes in chromatin accessibility, including ATAC-seq, FAIRE-seq, MNase-seq and DNAse-seq methods, which involve Next-generation-sequencing (NGS). Focusing on the adult Drosophila differentiated gut enterocytes (ECs) we used a sequencing-free method that enables visualizing and semi-quantifying large-scale changes in chromatin structure using in vitro methylation assay with the bacterial CpG Methyltransferase, M. Sssl, that determine chromatin accessibility. In brief, as CpG methylation is minimal in differentiated somatic Drosophila cells, we used the bacterial M.

e3436,Gallyas Silver Impregnation of Myelinated Nerve Fibers,"In the nervous system of vertebrates, nerve impulse propagation is accelerated by the ensheathment of neuronal axons with myelin. Myelin sheaths are molecularly specialized, lipid-rich plasma membrane extensions of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). To visualize myelinated nerve fibers and to allow for the morphological analyses of myelin in the brain and the spinal cord, an efficient method for silver impregnation of myelin has originally been developed by Ferenc Gallyas in 1979, referred to as Gallyas silver impregnation.

e977,Assay to Evaluate Vascular Permeability Induction in Mice,"Dengue virus infection usually courses as a benign self-limited fever, called dengue fever. However, on occasions it can progress to a life-threatening complication known as severe dengue (SD). A hallmark of SD is a sharp increase in vascular permeability. Secondary infections are considered a risk factor to develop SD, presumably through a mechanism called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection in cells with the capacity to bind antigen-antibody complexes, such as macrophages, and to trigger a subsequent aberrant cytokine response. The massive release of cytokine from macrophages has been postulated to cause changes in vascular permeability. The vascular permeability assay presented in this protocol is designed to assess whether any compound or cell-secreted product or soluble factor present in sera from patients may induce plasma leakage in mice. This test was used in the laboratory to determine whether cytokines and soluble factors produced in vitro by macrophages infected with dengue virus or dengue virus in the presence of facilitating antibodies are able to induce plasma leakage in vivo. Macrophages were infected with dengue virus or dengue virus in the presence of facilitating antibodies for 48 h. After this time, the conditioned supernatant containing cytokines and soluble factors released by the macrophages were collected and inoculated intraperitoneally into CD-1 mice. Twenty four hours after the first inoculation, mice were reinoculated with a second dose with Evans blue dye. After another 24 h, mice were euthanized and the amount of Evans blue present in the blood and lung was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. The assay was able to show differences in the capacity of the conditioned media to induce vascular permeability changes in the inoculated animals (Puerta-Guardo et al., 2013).","Assay to Evaluate Vascular Permeability Induction in Mice. Mice of six to seven weeks old and 18-20 g in weight in a minimal amount of 4 mice per group, were injected intraperitoneally with 2 doses (100 μl each) 24 h apart. The amount of Evans blue dye present in plasma was measured by spectrophotometry at 630 nm. Quantification was performed by comparison with a standard curve."," This protocol is designed to compare the permeability induction capacity of different cell supernatants, thus, in vitro, and in vivo, in vivo. This protocol can be used to evaluate the vascular permeability of the lung tissue. Any significant increase in permeability is considered as leakage induction by TNF-α, which is a plasma leakage inductor. However, results can also be expressed directly in ng/ml of lung tissue, as well as in vitro.", Vascular permeability induction is an assay to evaluate vascular leakage induction in mice. This protocol has been developed to study pulmonary capillary leakage induction (Figure 1). This protocol is based on the lung leakage induction capacity of the lung.,"The lung tissue was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 x g for 30 min), and the concentration of evans blue dye extracted in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 630 nm against a standard curve. Together with the second dose of conditioned supernatant, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 ml/kg of weight a 1% evans blue dye solution (w/v in pbs) allowing circulation for 24 h as was described previously (manaenko et al., 2011). Evans blue dye was extracted from the lung by incubation at 65 °c with formamide (2 ml/g tissue) overnight (peng et al., 2004). The standard curve was constructed using dilution of evans blue dye in 1x pbs in a range from 3 to 400 ng/ml (r = 0.999)."
e99,Transwell Cell Migration Assay Using Human Breast Epithelial Cancer Cell,"Transwell migration assays have been widely used for studying the motility of different types of cells including metastatic cancer cells. The assay is also useful in screens for compounds that act as chemoattractants or inhibitors of chemotaxis for cells. The assay employs a permeable layer of support, usually a tissue-culture-treated microporous membrane, which is positioned between two compartments that mimic two different sets of microenvironments for cell survival/growth. Cells on one side of the membrane, when sensing chemoattractants placed on the other side of the compartment that diffuses through the membrane, can migrate through the pores in the membrane towards the source of the chemoattractants. Cells that migrate across the membrane can be quantified by fixing and counting. Human breast epithelial adenocarcinoma MD-231 cells grow relatively fast and are metastatic. The MB-231 cell line is used here to describe the procedures of an in vitro cell migration assay using the transwell apparatus.",Transwell Cell Migration Assay Using Human Breast Epithelial Cancer Cell. Carry MB-231 cells in DMEM with 10% FBS (use L-15 medium if needed) Wash cells twice with 1x PBS and trypsinize. Add 0.5 mg/ml Trypsin inhibitor in PBS to inactivate an equal volume of TrypsIn. Aspirate cells by pipetting up and down gently.," The transwell cell migration assay is a widely used method to measure the cell migration of cancer cells in the human breast epithelial cells.

To the upper compartment, gently add 1 x 105 cells from step 4. incubate the cells in the transwell plate at 37 °c and 5% co2 for 2.5 h. this allows cells to migrate toward the underside of the insert filter. Remove excess crystal violet by quickly merging the insert in ddh2o for 3 to 4 sec. drain excess water from the side of the insert using a cotton swab. Cells that do not migrate through the pores and therefore remain on the upper side of the filter membrane need to be gently removed with a cotton swab."
e995,Preparation of Outer Membrane Vesicle from Escherichia coli,"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical bilayered phospholipids of 20-200 nm in size produced from all Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria investigated to date. Previous biochemical and proteomic studies have revealed that the Gram-negative bacteria-derived OMVs are composed of various components like outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane lipids, periplasmic proteins, DNA, and RNA. Here, in this protocol, we describe the method to isolate the OMVs from the culture supernatant of Escherichia coli (E. coli).","Bacteria are incubated in an orbital bacteria shaking incubator at 200 rpm at 37 °C overnight (8 h) LB broth of 500 ml is inoculated with 1/100 volume of the overnight cultured cells. The cells are pelleted at 5,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant is collected and filtered through a bottle top filter of pore size 0.45 μm using a vacuum pump."," A single colony of E. coli is transferred to 5 ml of LB broth in order to study the outer membrane of the inner membrane. The total volume of bacteria culture should be more than 5-7 liters. The yield of OMV in terms of protein amount is 100 μg per 1 liter of the bacteria. This is a very low level of protein concentration. However, depending on the amount of", The outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) is an outermembrane cell that is composed of a single cell that can be differentiated from a single colony of E. coli. Figure 1. This protocol describes the preparation of an outer membrane Vesicle.,"7 l of bacteria culture supernatant is concentrated to give about 280 ml of the concentrated supernatant to be filled in the total of four ultra-centrifuge tube (70 ml each). The resulting filtrate is subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 150,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °c. the supernatant is removed and the pellet (purified omv) is resuspended in pbs and stored at – 80 °c until use. Also, since 1/100 volume of 5 ml is 50 μl, before inoculation, increase the volume by adding about 900 μl of fresh lb medium to reduce cell loss. Note: because the yield of omvs is very low, in order to obtain a visible pellet after ultracentrifugation, the total volume of bacteria culture should be more than 5-7 liters."
