        "@value": "Assay to Evaluate Vascular Permeability Induction in Mice. Dengue virus infection usually courses as a benign self-limited fever, called dengue fever. However, on occasions it can progress to a life-threatening complication known as severe dengue (SD). A hallmark of SD is a sharp increase in vascular permeability. Secondary infections are considered a risk factor to develop SD, presumably through a mechanism called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection in cells with the capacity to bind antigen-antibody complexes, such as macrophages, and to trigger a subsequent aberrant cytokine response. The massive release of cytokine from macrophages has been postulated to cause changes in vascular permeability. The vascular permeability assay presented in this protocol is designed to assess whether any compound or cell-secreted product or soluble factor present in sera from patients may induce plasma leakage in mice. This test was used in the laboratory to determine whether cytokines and soluble factors produced in vitro by macrophages infected with dengue virus or dengue virus in the presence of facilitating antibodies are able to induce plasma leakage in vivo. Macrophages were infected with dengue virus or dengue virus in the presence of facilitating antibodies for 48 h. After this time, the conditioned supernatant containing cytokines and soluble factors released by the macrophages were collected and inoculated intraperitoneally into CD-1 mice. Twenty four hours after the first inoculation, mice were reinoculated with a second dose with Evans blue dye. After another 24 h, mice were euthanized and the amount of Evans blue present in the blood and lung was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. The assay was able to show differences in the capacity of the conditioned media to induce vascular permeability changes in the inoculated animals (Puerta-Guardo et al., 2013).. Mice of six to seven weeks old and 18-20 g in weight in a minimal amount of 4 mice per group, were injected intraperitoneally with 2 doses (100 μl each) 24 h apart, of media or supernatants to be evaluated. Since TNF-α has been described as a plasma leakage inductor, this cytokine can be used for the injection as positive control (4 ng/ml). Together with the second dose of conditioned supernatant, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 ml/kg of weight a 1% Evans blue dye solution (w/v in PBS) allowing circulation for 24 h as was described previously (Manaenko et al., 2011). Before samples were collected, mice were injected with anesthetics: ketamine (70 mg/kg) and xylazine (6 mg/kg), afterward blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. Blood was immediately placed in EDTA tubes. Samples were diluted 1:2 v/v in PBS and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 8 min. The amount of Evans blue dye present in plasma was measured by spectrophotometry at 630 nm. Quantification was performed by comparison with a standard curve. The standard curve was constructed using dilution of Evans blue dye in 1x PBS in a range from 3 to 400 ng/ml (R = 0.999). To evaluate the pulmonary capillary leakage, the mice were perfused transcardially with 50 ml of PBS followed by 20 ml of 10% Formalin for tissue fixation. The lung tissues were removed and preserved in formalin solution at 4 °C until analysis. The right lung was vacuum-dried, weight and frozen instantly in liquid nitrogen. Evans blue dye was extracted from the lung by incubation at 65 °C with formamide (2 ml/g tissue) overnight (Peng et al., 2004). The lung tissue was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 x g for 30 min), and the concentration of Evans blue dye extracted in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 630 nm against a standard curve. Concentration of Evans blue dye was determined in ng/ml of lung tissue. However, this study was designed to compare the permeability induction capacity of different cell supernatants, thus, results were expressed as fold increases in relation to the mock or control condition. Nevertheless, results can also be expressed directly in ng/ml of tissue. Any statistically significant increase between the control and the experimental conditions is considered as leakage induction (Figure 1).."

        "@value": "Method for Assessing Virulence of Colletotrichum higginsianum on Arabidopsis thaliana Leaves Using Automated Lesion Area Detection and Measurement. The plant pathogenic fungus, Colletotrichum higginsianum is widely used to understand infection mechanisms, as it infects the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To determine the virulence of C. higginsianum, several methods have been developed, such as disease reaction scoring, lesion measurement, entry rate assays, and relative fungal biomass assays using real-time quantitative PCR. Although many studies have taken advantage of these methods, they have shortcomings in terms of objectivity, time, or cost. Here, we show a lesion area detection method applying ImageJ color thresholds to images of A. thaliana leaves infected by C. higginsianum. This method can automatically detect multiple lesions in a short time without the requirement for special equipment and measures lesion areas in a standardized way. This high throughput technique will aid better understanding of plant immunity and pathogenicity and contribute to reproducibility of assays.. Preparation of A. thaliana plants and C. higginsianum culture Culture fungal strains on potato dextrose agar at 24 °C under 12-h black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions for 1 week (Figure 1A). Set up at least 8 replicate A. thaliana plants for each genotype to be tested in airtight transparent plastic containers with about 1 cm of water (Figure 1B). Note: The lid of this transparent plastic container should have a rubber seal to maintain 100% humidity conditions during infection. Mark 3 petioles of fully expanded leaves per plant using a permanent marker (Figure 1C). Note: We recommend completing all the steps given above before starting to prepare conidia suspensions. Figure 1. Preparation of A. thaliana plants and C. higginsianum culture. A. 7-day-old culture of C. higginsianum MAFF 305635 on potato dextrose agar incubated at 24 °C under 12-h black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions. B. Airtight transparent plastic container with A. thaliana plants. C. Marked petioles using a permanent marker (White arrows). Inoculation with C. higginsianum Place an autoclaved filter funnel in a 50 ml conical tube and fix a folded piece of nylon mesh to the funnel using a piece of surgical tape (Figure 2A). Add 10 ml of room temperature sterilized water to the fungal culture in a Petri dish and gently scrape the surface using an autoclaved painting brush to release conidia (Figure 2B). Pour the conidial suspension through the nylon mesh in the funnel to separate mycelia from conidia (Figure 2C). Note: Conidia should pass through the nylon mesh, but mycelia should not. After centrifugation at 4,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature, remove the supernatant by decanting (Figure 2D). Resuspend the conidial pellet in 2 ml of distilled water. Prepare a 1/100 diluted conidia suspension in distilled water in an Eppendorf® microcentrifuge tube and determine the concentration of the original suspension using a hemacytometer (Figure 2E). Note: Depending on the conidial concentration, you can prepare different dilution series to obtain ~100 conidia/mm2 on a hemacytometer. Prepare at least 1 ml of 5 x 105 conidia/ml suspension in an Eppendorf® microcentrifuge tube. Open the lid of the transparent plastic container and inoculate 5 μl of the conidia suspension per leaf on the surface of the selected leaves using a pipette (Figure 2F). Note: We recommend inoculating plants where they will be grown during pathotests to minimize the risk of the inoculated conidia suspension running off from the leaf surface during transportation. Spray tap water on the backside of a lid of a transparent plastic container using a spray bottle. Then, seal the lid of the container and carefully place the container in the growth chamber. Note: Do not open the lid until 5 days post-infection to maintain 100% humidity during infection. Figure 2. Inoculation with C. higginsianum. A. Setup to separate mycelia from conidia. B. Scraping the fungal culture using a painting brush to obtain conidia suspension. C. Filtering the conidia suspension through nylon mesh. D. Conidial pellet after centrifugation. E. Conidia on a hemacytometer (Black arrows). Bar = 100 μm. F. Inoculation of conidia on the leaf surface using a pipette. Preparing images of symptoms Set up a digital camera on a camera stand and set magnification, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Note: Adjust your camera and exposure settings to minimize shadows and reflections in the images. Make sure to use the same settings for reproducibility when you repeat experiments. For this reason, we also recommend taking photos in a room without windows to avoid the effect of sunshine. Open the lid of the transparent plastic container. If necessary, gently wipe water droplets on the leaf surface using a paper towel to avoid capturing water-reflected light. Cut the marked petioles, put leaves on a white tray and take photos. Note: The white tray provides a uniform white background for the images. Make sure to include a ruler in images of inoculated leaves.. Colletotrichum fungi cause anthracnose disease in a broad range of plants, including important crops, and have a serious economic impact (Cannon et al., 2012). Among Colletotrichum species, C. higginsianum infects Brassicaceae plants, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (O’Connell et al., 2004). Thus, this pathogen has been used for various studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms of plant immunity and pathogenicity (Birker et al., 2009; Narusaka et al., 2009; Kleemann et al., 2012; Takahara et al., 2016; Plaumann et al., 2018). Moreover, recently released high-quality genome assemblies of C. higginsianum provide genomic resources that should increase the use of this fungus in functional studies by facilitating the identification of candidate genes of interest (Zampounis et al., 2016; Tsushima et al., 2019). In order to determine the virulence of C. higginsianum, initial studies employed disease reaction scores based on visual observation and subjective judgement (O’Connell et al., 2004; Narusaka et al., 2004). The necessity for more objective approaches has led to the development of alternative methods including lesion diameter measurement, entry rate assays, and measurement of relative fungal biomass using real-time quantitative PCR (Narusaka et al., 2010; Hiruma and Saijo, 2016). These methods are commonly employed in studies using C. higginsianum, yet they have disadvantages, such as the variability of lesion shapes leading to differences in measured values between observers, time-consuming steps, or the economic burden of purchasing reagents. ImageJ has been used as an open source tool for the analysis of scientific images (Schneider et al., 2012). In the field of plant pathology, many studies have utilized ImageJ to analyze pathogenicity or resistance, for instance by measuring lesion sizes (Dagdas et al., 2016; Kumakura et al., 2019). However, these procedures can be further automated. Therefore, we developed an objective, automated, and affordable method to detect and measure lesion areas from images of A. thaliana leaves infected by C. higginsianum using ImageJ. In this article, we describe how to perform infection assays to study the A. thaliana-C. higginsianum interaction and how to detect and measure lesions using ImageJ macros to record multiple lesion areas at one time. This method enables us to reproducibly perform infection assays with the A. thaliana-C. higginsianum pathosystem and may be adapted to other pathosystems. For example, ImageJ color thresholds were also used to measure lesion areas on C. shisoi-infected A. thaliana (Gan et al., 2019). This protocol will allow us to perform objective and high throughput analyses to gain further insights into plant-microbe interactions."

        "@value": "Macrophage Inflammatory Assay. Macrophages represent a widely distributed and functionally diverse population of innate myeloid cells involved in inflammatory response to pathogens, tissue homeostasis and tissue repair (Murray and Wynn, 2011). Macrophages can be broadly grouped into two subpopulations with opposing activites: M1 or pro-inflammatory macrophages that promote T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell immunity and tissue damage, and M2 or anti-inflammatory/alternatively activated macrophages implicated in Th2 response and resolution of inflammation. Here we describe a rapid assay we used previously to monitor changes in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages in response to therapeutic paracrine factors produced by adult stem cells (Bartosh et al., 2010; Ylostalo et al., 2012; Bartosh et al., 2013). The assay can be adapted appropriately to test macrophage response to other agents as well that will be referred to herein as ‘test reagents’ or ‘test compounds’.In this protocol, the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 is expanded as an adherent monolayer on petri dishes allowing for the cells to be harvested easily without enzymes or cell scrapers that can damage the cells. The macropahges are then stimulated in suspension with LPS and seeded into 12-well cell culture plates containing the test reagents. After 16-18 h, the medium conditioned by the macrophages is harvested and the cytokine profile in the medium determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We routinely measure levels of the pro-inflammtory cytokine TNF-alpha and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10).. Preparation of macrophage cultures Expand the J774A.1 mouse macrophages in macrophage medium on a 15 cm petri dish. Notes: A detailed method for culture of mouse macrophages can be found in references below. Macrophage medium should be changed every 2-3 days. The use of petri dishes allows the macrophages to be harvested for the assay without dissociating enzymes and without the requirement of a cell scraper that can be damaging to the cells. Upon reaching 70-80% confluence, aspirate the culture medium from the dish and add 10 ml of fresh macrophage medium. Harvest the macrophages by washing them from the petri dish with the macrophage medium using a pipette-aid and 10 ml serological pipette. Note: Spray the medium over the macrophages multiple times to dislodge the cells from the dish. Transfer the macrophage suspension from the plate to a 50 ml conical tube. Add an additional 10 ml macrophage medium to the plate and repeat wash step. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 200-250 x g for 5-7 min. Suspend the macrophages in macrophage medium and count the cells. Notes: A 15 cm petri dish containing macrophages at 70% confluence should yield approximately 15 million macrophages. The macrophages will consistently have high viability when cultured and harvested as described. Therefore, the use of a viability dye such as trypan blue for distinguishing live versus dead cells is not mandatory. Prepare a suspension of the macrophages in macrophage medium at a density of 200,000 cells per ml. Preparation of assay plates (Figure 1) Determine the number of 12-well cell culture plates necessary to assay samples of interest in triplicate. Transfer the test compound(s) of interest in triplicate to the appropriate wells of a 12-well plate. Note: We have routinely tested the effects of mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium, prostaglandins such as PGE2, various pharmacological compounds, neutralizing antibodies and recombinant proteins. Add macrophage medium to all wells containing a test reagent to a final volume of 500 µl. Note: If the volume of the test compound employed is minute, it is advantageous to first add the macrophage medium to the wells and then transfer the test compound of interest (from step B9) to the appropriate wells. The final volume in each well should remain 500 µl. Add 500 µl macrophage medium to 6 additional wells not containing a test reagent. Note: These wells will provide controls for the assay. Transfer 500 µl of the macrophage cell suspension (100,000 cells) to each of 3 wells containing 500 µl of macrophage medium only (without a test reagent). Note: These wells will serve as unstimulated macrophage controls (Mac controls, Figure 1). Figure 1. Sample plate layout for the macrophage assay. To prepare the 12-well assay plate, the test reagents of interest are first added to the appropriate wells in triplicate (shown here in columns 3 and 4). Macrophage (Mac) medium is then added to every well to a final volume of 500 μl followed by addition of 500 μl of the Mac cell suspension to each well in the first column (unstimulated Mac control). 500 μl of the LPS-stimulated macrophages (LPS-Mac) are transferred to each of the remaining 9 wells (columns 2, 3, and 4). Note that three of these wells do not contain a test reagent (shown here in column 2) and therefore serve as the LPS-stimulated macrophage control (LPS-Mac control). The final volume per well is 1.0 ml. For simplicity, wells containing a vehicle control for the test reagents have been omitted. Macrophage stimulation with LPS Stimulate the macrophages by adding a 1:500 dilution of the 0.1 mg/ml solution of LPS to the remainder of the macrophage suspension. To distribute the LPS, immediately mix the cell suspension by pipetting up and down 10-15 times. Place the cap on the 50 ml tube containing the LPS-stimulated macrophages and incubate the cells in the 50 ml tube for 5 min at room temperature. Mix the cells again then transfer 500 µl (100,000 cells) to the appropriate wells containing the test samples. Also, add 500 µl of the macrophage suspension to the three remaining wells containing 500 µl macrophage medium only (LPS-stimulated macrophage controls) (Figure 1). Rock the plate 3 times to distribute the macrophages evenly across the well and incubate at 37 °C for up to 24 h. Each well for the assay finally contains 100,000 macrophages in 1.0 ml macrophage medium and 100 ng/ml LPS (except the three unstimulated control wells). Note: We routinely incubate the macrophages with LPS for approximately 16-18 h. However, an abundance of macrophage-derived cytokines can be detected in the conditioned medium as early as 4-6 h after LPS stimulation. Collection of conditioned medium for assays of cytokine production Prior to collecting the medium conditioned by the macrophages, observe the cultures to verify the cells were properly activated (Figure 2). Note: J774A.1 macrophages stimulated with LPS appear larger, flatter, and more granular than un-stimulated macrophages. Figure 2. Changes in macrophage morphology in response to LPS. Brightfield images of unsimlulated macrophages (left) and macrophages stimulated with LPS for 18 h (right). Scale bar = 50 µm Collect the medium conditioned by the macrophages and place it into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at 500 x g, room temperature. Transfer the supernatant to new 1.5 ml tubes. Notes: Although a cell pellet should not be visible, avoid touching the bottom of the tube when removing the supernatant. The samples can be used immediately for ELISA assay or aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Vortex the medium samples prior to their use in TNF-alpha and IL-10 ELISA assays. Follow instructions provided by the manufacturer of the ELISA kits. The absorbance of the wells can be read on a microplate reader with a wavelength of 450 nm and background wavelength correction set at 540 nm or 570 nm. Representative amounts of TNF-alpha and IL-10 produced by macrophages in response to LPS and a test compound (PGE2) are shown in the graphs below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Effects of LPS and PGE2 on TNF-alpha and IL-10 production by macrophages. Macrophages were stimulated for 18 h with 100 ng/ml LPS alone or LPS in combination with 1 ng/ml of the immune modulatory factor prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). LPS increases levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha produced by the macrophages. PGE2 attenuates macrophage production of TNF-alpha elicited by LPS stimulation but enhances levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Values are mean +/- SD, n=3 per group.."

        "@value": "Probabilistic Models for Predicting Mutational Routes to New Adaptive Phenotypes. Understanding the translation of genetic variation to phenotypic variation is a fundamental problem in genetics and evolutionary biology. The introduction of new genetic variation through mutation can lead to new adaptive phenotypes, but the complexity of the genotype-to-phenotype map makes it challenging to predict the phenotypic effects of mutation. Metabolic models, in conjunction with flux balance analysis, have been used to predict evolutionary optimality. These methods however rely on large scale models of metabolism, describe a limited set of phenotypes, and assume that selection for growth rate is the prime evolutionary driver. Here we describe a method for computing the relative likelihood that mutational change will translate into a phenotypic change between two molecular pathways. The interactions of molecular components in the pathways are modeled with ordinary differential equations. Unknown parameters are offset by probability distributions that describe the concentrations of molecular components, the reaction rates for different molecular processes, and the effects of mutations. Finally, the likelihood that mutations in a pathway will yield phenotypic change is estimated with stochastic simulations.One advantage of this method is that only basic knowledge of the interaction network underlying a phenotype is required. However, it can also incorporate available information about concentrations and reaction rates as well as mutational biases and mutational robustness of molecular components. The method estimates the relative probabilities that different pathways produce phenotypic change, which can be combined with fitness models to predict evolutionary outcomes.. Build mathematical models of the molecular pathways that enable comparison Identify the set of biochemical reactions in each molecular pathway that determine expression of a particular phenotype. The types of reactions can vary depending on the pathway modeled and can include, for example, enzymatic reactions, conformational changes in proteins, oligomerization, and transcription initiation. The reactions should link the expression of the phenotype to some indicator, e.g., a biochemical compound (or function of compounds). For example, if the phenotype is the color of an organism then an appropriate indicator might be the amount of a pigment compound. In the article where this method was first used (Lind et al., 2019) the indicators were three diguanylate cyclase enzymes that could each be activated by mutations in their regulatory networks. For each set of biochemical reactions, formulate a system of differential equations that describes the reaction kinetics of the indicator (see Figure 1 for example). Each pathway is likely affected by biochemical compounds whose dynamics are governed by external pathways. It is often better to treat these compounds as constants rather than include more differential equations for their dynamics. For instance, if a pathway affects an indicator through phosphorylation then the intracellular pool of phosphate groups may be held as a constant rather than modeled through an additional set of differential equations. In general, it also helps to keep a similar level of detail/abstraction across the models of the pathways for better comparison. As an example, in (Lind et al., 2019) the models of the different pathways focused on the interactions between proteins and ignored processes involving transcription. Figure 2. Modeling of the AWS network. The reactions of the AWS regulatory network from (Lind et al., 2019) can be illustrated by an interaction diagram. The mathematical model of AWS is a system of ordinary differential equations describing all reactions and rates. In this case, the active dimer RR is the indicator of phenotypic change. Choose parameter distributions to solve the differential equations We assume that the systems of differential equations used to model the pathways cannot be solved analytically. To solve each system of differential equations numerically, three key pieces of information are needed: Initial concentrations of the molecular compounds. Reaction rates for the interactions between compounds. Time interval over which to solve the differential equations. It is possible that all pieces of information are known for a model in which case there will be only one numerical solution for each pathway model. In most cases, however, information is missing and must be estimated. If there is any information concerning a) or b) that is known or can be estimated from empirical data then use this to constrain the sampling procedure. For unknown concentrations or reaction rates, choose a distribution for each that seems reasonable based on empirical data or at least encompasses a broad spectrum of likely dynamics. For instance, in Lind et al. (2019) there was no information concerning reaction rates or concentrations, so the authors chose the distribution for the reaction rates to be a uniform distribution on log space (i.e., 10U[−2,2]) and the distribution for initial concentrations to be a uniform distribution U[0,10]. These choices were in line with other pathway reaction kinetic models and allowed for numerically stable solutions. Importantly, whatever distributions are chosen, it is useful to see the effects of different choices on the results of the pathway comparison as part of a post-analysis parameter sensitivity study. The time interval for numerical solving the differential equations depends on the particular molecular system and the dynamics of the indicator compound. If the indicator reaches a steady state then that might set the time interval; however, in some systems transient, short-term behavior may be more biologically relevant. A distribution could be chosen for the time to solve the differential equations; however, in practice it is often faster and easier to evaluate the results when a fixed time is chosen and used for all models–especially when all other parameters are sampled randomly. Choose distributions for the effects of mutations and the amount of change in the indicator compound that corresponds to phenotypic change The prior steps allow for the computation of the indicator compound in each pathway, as a baseline for comparison. The choices made in this step will allow numerical solution of a pathway’s differential equation model following a mutation (or set of mutations) and determination of whether the phenotype has changed. We assume that the relevant mutations to a pathway are those that alter reaction rates, i.e., change the internal dynamics of a pathway, and we classify mutations as enabling or disabling based on whether they increase/decrease reaction rates. Thus, we need a way of determining new reaction rate(s) in the differential equation model of a pathway, following a mutation (or a set of mutations). Ideally, one would have information on all possible mutations and their effects on reaction rates. However, this is unlikely to be available. In the absence of empirical data, a distribution should be picked such that given a reaction rate and whether a mutation increases or decreases reaction rates, a new reaction rate is determined. For example, in (Lind et al., 2019) enabling mutations were assumed to affect reaction rates multiplicatively and thus new reaction rates were computed as the product of the original reaction rate and a multiplicative factor sampled from 10U[0,2] (similarly a factor of 10U[−2,0]) was used for disabling mutations. The differential equation models for each pathway link the concentration of an indicator compound to a phenotype. Since the sampling distributions in Step B may result in different baseline concentrations of indicator compound, there needs to be a way of assessing whether a mutation (or set of mutations) produces a phenotypic change. In the absence of empirical data, a simple approach is to establish that if the indicator increases in concentration above some threshold then the phenotype changes. The actual threshold will depend on the biological system and how much of a change in the indicator is biologically relevant. Without this information, the threshold should be high enough to avoid issues of numerical precision and will depend on the differential equation solver and its parameters (e.g., step sizes in Runge-Kutta methods). For simplicity, we used a threshold of 0.000001 which was similar in magnitude to the numerical tolerances used in the differential equation solver. Run simulation routine to compute the likelihood of a phenotypic change given all combinations of mutations Use the code “Run Model Comparison” (https://github.com/ericlibby/BioProtocol/blob/master/RunModelComparison.m) to generate the data. The pseudocode for “Run Model Comparison” is included below as Algorithm 1 (Figure 3). “Run Model Comparison” use the procedure “Phenotype Change” for each pathway to compute the probability that mutation in a pathway causes a phenotypic change. The pseudocode for “Phenotype Change” is shown in Figure 3. “Phenotype Change” uses several procedures to set the parameter distributions (Procedure B, C above). The pseudocode for these are shown in Figure 4. To visualize the results, use the code “Plot Model Comparison” (https://github.com/ericlibby/BioProtocol/blob/master/PlotModelComparison.m) to create a contour plot that shows the log2 ratio of relative probabilities between two pathways with axes denoting the probabilities of enabling and disabling change. Figure 3. Pseudocode for the “RunModelComparison” and “PhenotypeChange” procedures. “PhenotypeChange” compute the probability that mutation in a pathway causes a phenotypic change. “RunModelComparison” computes the relative likelihood that Pathway 1 is used relative to Pathway 2. MATLAB code for RunModelComparison is available at https://github.com/ericlibby/BioProtocol/blob/master/RunModelComparison.m. Figure 4. Pseudocode for procedures used by “PhenotypeChange” procedure shown in Figure 3. The SolveModel procedure is not listed as it is assumed to be a numerical solver available as a built-in function or from a library/package.. The ability to forecast evolution would not only make evolutionary biology more predictive but could have translational impact with applications in biotechnology (e.g., synthetic biology or biofuels) or medicine (e.g., antibiotic resistance or cancer). Most previous success in evolutionary forecasting has been in asexual microbial populations subject to strong selection and relies on extensive historical sequence data to estimate the fitness of different strains (Luksza and Lassig 2014; Neher et al., 2014). Such models are not based on the mechanistic details of how mutations translate into fitness differences. The models also assume that selection is the main determinant of evolutionary outcomes which is a limiting assumption because evolutionary routes can be significantly influenced by factors other than selection. For example, if the rate of phenotypic production differs across evolutionary routes then more likely mutations that confer small gains in fitness may be observed more often than rare mutations that confer large fitness gains; being first may be more important than being best. In such cases, accurate prediction of the mutational routes to adaptive phenotypes requires knowledge of their relative rates of phenotypic production. The rates of phenotypic production can be shaped by a variety of factors. For instance, a higher rate of phenotypic production can be caused by mutational hotspots, which are sections of DNA that increase the frequency of mutational events in nearby genes. Another possibility is that some genes have a greater capacity to translate mutation into phenotypic change, i.e., have a larger number of sites that can be mutated with functional effects. This can due to the properties of the individual protein (Lind et al., 2017) or ncRNA, in terms of mutational robustness, but also because proteins and ncRNAs have different functions in the molecular interaction networks underpinning adaptive phenotypes (Lind et al., 2015 and 2019). A simple example of the latter case would be when expression of a gene is controlled by both a negative and a positive regulator, activation of that gene occurs more often through mutations in the negative regulator simply due to loss-of-function mutations being more likely than gain-of-function mutations. To account for the factors affecting the rate of phenotypic production, mechanistic information is needed. An arena in which mechanistic information has been used to successfully predict evolution is in metabolism (Edwards and Palsson 2000; O'Brien et al., 2015). There is a wealth of data on the biochemical reactions involved in central metabolism in different microbial species. This data can be used to form explicit metabolic models that in conjunction with a technique known as flux balance analysis can predict the growth rate of an organism in simple environments. By manipulating which reactions are present in the metabolic model, the phenotypic effects, i.e., growth rates, of mutational knockouts can be predicted. Similar metabolic models have also been used to predict how organisms will interact in different environments via the exchange of biochemical compounds including spatio-temporal interactions (Liu et al., 2015; Bocci et al., 2018). While the metabolic models have been successful in certain evolutionary predictions, they are limited in their applicability: they focus mainly on growth phenotypes in environments in which organisms are assumed to be actively reproducing. Moreover, the growth phenotypes are computed using large-scale models with hundreds or thousands of reactions and typically involve optimization of a “biomass’’ function of some 50+ variables. The models also do not usually incorporate any type of regulation, e.g., transcriptional/translational control or protein modifications, but see Chandrasekaran and Price, 2010 for one such example. Thus, they are not well suited to generalizations outside of metabolism. Here we describe a method to predict the rates that mutational changes to different molecular networks produce phenotypic change. One advantage of this method is that only knowledge of the general architecture of the molecular networks is needed to make a prediction. However information about reaction rates, concentrations, mutation rates and gene size, mutational robustness of components can be included if known. The method can incorporate different types of reactions, for example conformational changes and enzymatic reactions, and the phenotypes predicted are not limited to optimization for growth rate. Predictions generated by the method could potentially be combined with origin-fixation models (McCandlish and Stoltzfus, 2014) in order to predict the mutation rate to an adaptive phenotype in the absence of unbiased experimental data that is often difficult to obtain. Information about mutational biases (Lind et al., 2019) and the molecular effects of mutations on protein function from different prediction methods (Capriotti et al., 2005; Bromberg and Rost, 2007; Kumar et al., 2009; Dehouck et al., 2011; Capriotti et al., 2013; Celniker et al., 2013; Yates et al., 2014; Choi and Chan, 2015) can be incorporated into the model described here to adjust the rates of disabling and enabling mutation in different genes. The method described here is also useful for providing null models in order to test the causes of repeated evolution (Lind, 2018; Lind et al., 2019). It could also be one component in understanding the molecular bases of complex genetic diseases and for evolutionary forecasting of antibiotic resistance and cancer, especially when experimental data is incomplete."

        "@value": "Non-aqueous Fractionation (NAF) for Metabolite Analysis in Subcellular Compartments of Arabidopsis Leaf Tissues. The accurate determination of metabolite distribution in subcellular compartments is still challenging in plant science. Various methodologies, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based technology, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and protoplast fractionation allow the study of metabolite compartmentation. However, large changes in metabolite levels occur during such procedures. Therefore, the non-aqueous fractionation (NAF) technique is currently the best method for the study of in-vivo metabolite distribution. Our protocol presents a detailed workflow including the NAF procedure and quantification of compartment-specific markers for three subcellular compartments: ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) as plastidic marker, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) as cytosolic marker, and nitrate and acid invertase as vacuolar markers.. Harvesting, grinding and preparation of leaf material Harvest Arabidopsis thaliana leaf material and place into a 20 ml Polyvial (containing steel balls of three different diameters 3, 5, and 7 mm, two of each size in each 20 ml Polyvial) pre-cooled in liquid N2 and snap-freeze in liquid N2. Note: If the metabolites of interest have extremely fast turn-over time, plant material should be harvested by cutting rosettes and quenching them instantaneously in a bath of liquid N2 under the prevailing irradiance. The quenched material is then transferred into a 20 ml Polyvial (containing steel balls) pre-cooled in liquid N2. For an optimal grinding process, fill the vial to a maximum of 2/3 of its volume with the plant material. For NAF, 4 g of material is necessary, but it is recommended to harvest slightly more in order to have extra material to perform additional analysis in this material (such as quantification of metabolites, see section Data analysis–4). For homogenization, replace the plastic lids of the Polyvials by steel caps and place the Polyvials containing the leaf material into a pre-cooled steel grinding adapter for the Retsch mill (Figures 1A-1D). Note: Our grinding adapters and steel caps are custom-made for the 20 ml Polyvials. Alternatively, the grinding of the leaf material can be performed by using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. Make sure that the leaf material is kept frozen during the whole procedure. Homogenize the tissue for 1 min at 25 Hz (two times) in the Retsch mill (Figures 1E and 1F). Note: Make sure that the ground tissue is very well homogenized (thin powder). We suggest grinding the leaf material twice for 1 min each at 25 Hz. Cool down the vials and adapters in between with liquid N2 to avoid thawing of the material. Figure 1. Grinding procedure. A. Cool down the Polyvials, steel grinding adapter, and steel caps in liquid nitrogen. B. Remove the plastic lid of the Polyvials and place the steel cap frozen. C. Use a capper/decapper machine (custom-made) to close the vial with the steel cap. D. Closed vial. E. Place the Polyvial inside steel grinding adapter. F. Place the grinding adapter in the Retsch mill and proceed as in Step A3. After grinding use the same capper/decapper machine for replacing the steel caps for the plastic lids. The samples can be stored at -80 °C or proceed to Step A4. Note that to avoid overheating of the vial, steel caps and grinding adapter deep them in liquid nitrogen or make use of dried ice while preparing a second sample. Weigh ~4 g of frozen tissue into a 50 ml Falcon tube pre-cooled in liquid N2.The samples can be stored at -80 °C for up to three months. Prepare as many Falcon tubes as necessary (each one will be used for one NAF). Note: Label the Falcon tubes and their corresponding lids. Record the weights of the empty Falcon tubes (with lids) and the precise amount of plant material weighed. Freeze dry the homogenate. To avoid losing leaf material during this process, remove the lid and cover the Falcon tubes with paper tissue (KimWipes) fixed with an elastic band. Place the tubes in a metal rack into the freeze drier at 0.02 bar and -80 °C for 5 days. Close the tubes with their corresponding lids immediately after removing them from the freeze drier. The dried material can be stored under vacuum in a desiccator protected from light and humidity up to 6 months. Note: In order to avoid thawing, place the Falcon tubes in a polystyrene box containing dry ice and replace the lids by the paper tissue while the Falcon tubes are in the box. Determine the plant material dry weight by weighing the closed Falcon tubes after the freeze drying process. Preparation of solutions and filters Prepare the solutions for the NAF three days before starting the fractionation. Add the activated molecular sieve 4 Å to the Heptane (C7H16) and Tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4) solutions to ensure that no residual water is present. Prepare a mixture of Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane 66:34 (v/v); density = 1.3 g cm-3. Add the activated molecular sieve 4 Å and store the mixture protected from light in a brown glass bottle. Note: We usually use the ~100 ml of activated molecular sieve in a 1 L bottle. For 10 samples it is needed: a) 1 L of the Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture 66:34 (v/v): 660 ml of Tetrachloroethylene + 340 ml of Heptane, b) 2 L of Heptane, c) 500 ml of Tetrachloroethylene. Before use always check the pH of the solutions with a pH paper, especially Tetrachloroethylene. pH should be neutral. If Tetrachloroethylene solution turns acidic, the dried leaf material will become brown during gradient centrifugation and the NAF will fail. Cut 15 cm x 15 cm the nylon filters (one per NAF), weigh them and store them in clean 50 ml Falcon tubes. Fractionation procedure Note: The whole procedure should be performed under a fume hood. Only dried aliquots (after Step C17) can be processed on regular bench. For pouring solutions, use glass pipettes. Resuspend the dried leaf material in 20 ml of the Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane = 66:34 (v/v) mixture. Ultrasonicate the suspension for 2 min, with 6 x 10 cycles, 65% of power (Figure 2). To avoid overheating the suspension during the sonication process, keep the Falcon tube in an ice bath. Note: Place the sonicator tip inside the solution, but avoid touching the tube wall. Make sure the sonication is successful. This is a critical step in the fractionation, since insufficient sonication can produce aggregates that do not pass through nylon mesh. Figure 2. Setup for the ultrasonication procedure. Note that to avoid overheating the suspension during the process, the Falcon tube should be kept in an ice bath. Fold a nylon mesh into a glass funnel placed on top of a 50 ml Falcon tube and pour the suspension through the nylon mesh. Wash the nylon mesh 3 x with 10 ml of heptane. Note: The first two washing steps are performed by slowly pouring heptane on the nylon mesh and collecting the flow through in the Falcon tube below. For the third washing step, remove all the residual solution in the nylon mesh by squeezing it (while wearing adequate gloves). Place the nylon mesh back in a 50 ml Falcon tube and continue at Step C16. Be careful that all liquid go through the nylon mesh. If it´s the case, filter the whole obtained mixture again through a fresh nylon mesh. Centrifuge for 10 min at 3,200 x g and 4 °C, using a swing-out rotor. Discard the supernatant (by pouring it into a waste glass bottle) and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane = 66:34 (v/v) mixture. Transfer 100 µl of the well homogenized resuspended pellet into a 1.5 ml screw cap tube. This aliquot is named fraction 0 (F0) and corresponds to the unfractionated material. Prepare three aliquots, add 900 µl of C7H16 to each, and keep protected from the light and continue at Step C15. Note: Use a cut 200 µl pipette tip to collect F0. Homogenize well the mixture before taking each aliquot. Prepare the NAF gradient (Figure 3A): Linear gradient (30 ml, density from 1.43 to 1.62 g cm-3) With a Pasteur pipette fill the 50 ml Falcon tube A with Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture and the 50 ml Falcon tube B with Tetrachloroethylene. The dispensing needle is placed above a waste container. Note: Ensure that there are no air bubbles in any tubing by purging thoroughly the whole system. Set the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.15 ml min-1 and the following program: Step ml Solvent A Solvent B 1* 0 70% 30% 2** 3 70% 30% 3 28 0% 100% 4 33 0% 100% Notes: *After 3 ml, pause the program. This step is used to ensure that the first mixture reaches the end of the dispensing needle before starting the actual gradient. **Remove the waste container and place the Polyallomer tube at this step. The needle should be placed slightly over the bottom of the Polyallomer tube and slightly touching the side of the tube (Figure 3B). Re-start the program. Figure 3. Setup of the gradient pump and the mixer. A. Overview of the setup for preparing the NAF gradient. Solution A (Tetrachloroethylene/Heptane mixture) and solution B (Tetrachloroethylene). B. Detail of the bottom-up preparation of the gradient. Tube holder is a 50 ml falcon tube with paper support on the bottom to help holding the gradient tube. Take the needle carefully out from the gradient and place the Polyallomer tube in a rack. Apply the suspension from Step C4 to the gradient, very carefully with a Pasteur pipette. Touch the wall of the tube with the pipette slightly above the gradient and release carefully to avoid disturbing the gradient. Place the gradients in the appropriate tube buckets from the ultracentrifuge. Verify their weights and to counterbalance, adjust the weight by adding 100% C2Cl4. Centrifuge for 50 min at 5,000 x g, and 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor. Note: We always use the Ultracentrifuge Beckman Coulter OptimaTM L80 XP and Swinging bucket rotor Beckman Coulter SW32Ti. Set the acceleration/deceleration on three. Place the gradient tubes in a rack and mark eight fractions. Figure 4 illustrates how we usually separate the fractions based on the color. Figure 4. NAF gradient after centrifugation. Usually, we separate eight fractions based on their color. The dark green layer is enriched in chloroplast and usually divided into two fractions (F2 and F3) to avoid metabolite overloading. Note that fraction 8 is a pellet, which is the vacuolar-enriched fraction. Transfer carefully each fraction into clearly labeled clean 50 ml Falcon tube by using Pasteur pipette. The fractions are collected starting from the upper part (F1) to the bottom (F8). After F7 is removed, the pellet is resuspended in 20 ml heptane and the mixture transferred to a clean 50 ml Falcon tube. Use a new pipette for each fraction. Note: Transferring the fractions is a critical point for the method, since at this step cross contamination of the fractions should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore, always transfer the fractions from the very top of each layer. Add heptane up to 20 ml to the Falcon tubes containing F1 to F8 and mix carefully. Centrifuge all Falcon tubes for 10 min at 3,200 x g and at room temperature. Discard the supernatant (by carefully pouring it into a waste glass bottle) and resuspend the pellet with 7 ml of Heptane. Note: The volume depends on how many aliquots you will need for your analysis. We usually prepare seven sub-aliquots per fraction. This number is enough for various metabolite analysis and determination of the compartment-specific markers. Transfer 6 x 1 ml from each suspension into 1.5 ml screw caps tubes. The pellet can easily re-aggregate at this step. Keep mixing by hand the solution while transferring into the tubes in order to obtain homogeneous aliquots from the same fraction. Note: Use a cut 1000 µl pipette tip to collect sub-aliquots from each fraction. As adding 7 ml generally does not allow to obtain seven aliquots of 1 ml, we generally take 0.8 ml for the seventh aliquot and clearly label the corresponding tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g and at room temperature. Discard excess of supernatant (c.a. 900 µl) carefully, using a 1000 µl pipette tip. Process the F0 aliquots obtained in Step C5 in the same manner. Place the screw caps tubes containing the sub-aliquots open in racks inside of a desiccator connected to a vacuum pump. Also, place the open Falcon tubes containing the filters from Step C3. Keep the aliquots under vacuum and protected from light overnight. Close the tubes and store them at -80 °C until further process. Weigh the dried filters. Measurements of metabolite markers Extraction Add to the dried aliquots a steel ball and 250 µl 80% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7 to the samples. Place the tubes in a cooled (4 °C) holder for the ball mill and disrupt the pellet for 1 min at 25 Hz. Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C and 1000 rpm. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a 96-deep well plate and keep it protected from light and on ice. Add to the Pellet 150 µl 80% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7. Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C 1000 rpm. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer and combine with the previous supernatant. Add to the Pellet 250 µl 50% ethanol/10 mM HEPES pH 7. Incubate in a thermomixer for 30 min at 95 °C and 1,000 rpm. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer and combine with the previous two supernatants. It can be stored at -20 °C until further use. Nitrate (vacuolar marker) Nitrate content is determined following Cross et al. (2006). Nitrate can be used as a vacuolar marker in addition or alternatively to Acid Invertase. Note: Nitrite content must be determined and subtracted from the Nitrate values. For measuring nitrite content, nitrate reductase is replaced by water in the assay mix. Solutions: For storage recommendations, the solutions for nitrate measurement can be stored as follow: Solution: Storage temperature Potassium phosphate buffer 1 M pH 7.5 -20 °C NADPH 50 mM in NaOH 20 mM -80 °C Nitrate reductase (5 U ml-1 in Potassium phosphate buffer 0.1 M) -80 °C PES 0.25 mM -80 °C Sulfanilamide 1% (w/v) in phosphoric acid 5% 4 °C NNEDA 0.02% (w/v) 4 °C Nitrate standards -80 °C Nitrate Standards: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mM in 70% ETOH with 10 mM MES pH 5.9 Protocol: For one reaction, dispense in a 96-well plate 95 µl of the assay mix: 10.0 µl phosphate buffer 0.5 µl NADPH 2.0 µl Nitrate reductase 82.5 µl deionized water Add 5 µl of standard or extract (1 to 10 diluted extract). Mix and incubate for 30 min at 25 °C, protected from light. Add 15 µl of PES. Mix and incubate for 20 min at 25 °C, protected from light. Add 50 µl of Sulphanilamide and 50 µl of NNEDA. Mix and incubate for 10 min at 25 °C, protected from light. Read the plate at 540 nm in a microplate reader. Measurements of enzyme markers Enzyme extraction Add to the dried extract ~2 mg of PVPP (one little spoon), one steel ball (5 mm diameter), and 500 µl of buffer 1x (see Recipe 1b). Keep the samples on ice. Place the tubes in a cooled (4 °C) holder for the ball mill and disrupt the pellet for 1 min at 25 Hz. Make sure that the entire pellet is dissolved. If not, repeat the pellet disruption procedure. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,800 x g and 4 °C. Transfer the enzyme extract (supernatant) to a 96 deep-well plate. Keep on ice and proceed to the enzyme assays. If required, the supernatant can be stored at -80 °C. Enzyme assays All the three enzyme markers are measured according to Gibon et al. (2004). AGPase activity (plastid marker) Dispense in a 96-well plate placed on ice: 14 µl of AGPase assay mix (see Recipe B2b) 6 µl of standard or extract. Mix and incubate for 20 min at 25 °C. Add 20 µl of 0.5 M HCl in 100 mM Tricine/KOH pH 8. Mix and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Add 20 µl of 0.5 M NaOH. Mix, add 50 µl of AGPase Determination mix (see Recipe B2c). Mix, spin down, and read at wavelength of 340 nm and 30 °C until the maximum rate of reaction stabilizes. PEPC (Cytosol marker) Dispense in a 96-well plate placed on ice. 18 µl PEPC Assay Mix (see Recipe B3b) 2 µl of standard or extract Mix and incubate for 20 min at 25 °C. Add 20 µl of 0.5 M HCl in 100 mM Tricine/KOH pH 9. Mix, spin down, and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min. Cool and spin down. Keep the plate on ice. Add 20 µl 0.5 M NaOH. Mix, add 45 µl of PEPC Determination mix (see Recipe 3c, protect from light). Add 5 µl of 4 mM PES (protect from light). Mix and read at wavelength of 570 nm and 30 °C until the maximum rate of reaction stabilizes. Acid Invertase (Vacuole marker) Dispense in a black 96-well microplate: 10 µl Acid invertase Assay mix (see Recipe B4b) 5 µl of standard or enzyme extract Mix and incubate at 25 °C for 5 and 40 min. Add 10 µl 0.5 M NaOH. Mix and incubate at R.T. for 10 min. Add 10 µl 0.5 M HCl in 100 mM Tricine/KOH pH 8. Mix and add 50 µl of Acid invertase Determination mix (see Recipe B4c). Mix and read the fluorescence for 10-15 min using the following setting: Excitation at 530 nm, emission at 590 nm, temperature: 30 °C, sensitivity at 25. Use the rate of reaction for calculations. We use the Synergy fluorescence meter.. Metabolic activity and functionality require precise compartmentation of metabolism in eukaryotic cells. Despite knowing the spatial organization of metabolism within the plant cells, deciphering localization of the metabolites is still challenging due to metabolite redundancy, leakage, rapid turnover, futile cycling, and sophisticated transport systems and storage (Lunn, 2007; Klie et al., 2011; Sweetlove and Fernie, 2013). Several methods have been established to investigate metabolite compartmentation, among them non-aqueous fractionation (NAF) has been widely used for decades to determine the in-vivo subcellular metabolite distributions in eukaryotic cells. Firstly developed in animal sciences (Elbers et al., 1974), NAF was subsequently applied to plant leaf material from spinach (Gerhardt and Heldt, 1984 and 1987), bean (Sharkey and Vanderveer, 1989), maize (Weiner and Heldt, 1992) or barley (Winter et al., 1993). NAF is also successfully applied to rose petals (Yamada et al., 2009) and potato tubers (Farre et al., 2001). More recently, NAF has also been optimized to study metabolite compartmentation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Fettke et al., 2005; Krueger et al., 2009 and 2011; Klie et al., 2011; Arrivault et al., 2014; Shapiguzov et al., 2019). The NAF procedure prevents modification of metabolite levels (for example due to enzymatic activity) by having all steps performed at extremely low temperatures or under anhydrous conditions (Gerhardt and Heldt, 1984). After quenching plant material in liquid nitrogen, the frozen material is dehydrated by freeze drying, homogenized, and then applied to a gradient made of anhydrous organic solvents prior to centrifugation and subsequent collection of fractions. Subcellular compartments are separated on the basis of density in the centrifugation step and the fractions collected are enriched in organelles (such as chloroplasts, cytosol or vacuole; Gerhardt and Heldt, 1984; Lunn, 2006). By correlating the compartment-specific marker distributions with metabolite distributions over the gradient, it is possible to calculate compartment-specific metabolite distributions (Gerhardt and Heldt, 1984; Klie et al., 2011; Krueger et al., 2011). The software tool BestFit enables such calculations (Krueger et al., 2011 and 2014; Klie et al., 2011). Recently, a benchtop NAF method has been established and is adapted for a relatively small amount of tissue material (Fürtauer et al., 2016). This benchtop NAF method can be used as an alternative to the conventional NAF procedure. However, we still believe that the conventional NAF procedure is the method of choice for the determination of in vivo metabolite distribution among cellular compartments as (i) the plastidic and vacuolar compartments are more clearly separated on the density gradient used, and (ii) the higher amount of starting material leads to more material in each obtained fraction, giving the advantage to increase the number of sub-aliquots per fraction (thus increasing the range of measurements which can be done) and also to apply less sensitive quantification methods than mass spectrometry-based methods. A good example of the use of the conventional NAF procedure is a study performed by Arrivault et al. (2014) in which the distribution of about 1,000 proteins and 70 metabolites, including 22 phosphorylated intermediates in Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were analyzed, using the conventional NAF combined with MS-based approaches.The protocol presented here is based on the method described by Krueger et al. (2014) with minor modifications. In our method, we provide a complete workflow for the NAF procedure in Arabidopsis thaliana and detailed information for the analysis of compartment–specific marker enzymes and metabolites which can be assigned to three subcellular compartments: ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) as plastidic marker, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) as cytosolic marker and nitrate and acid invertase as vacuolar markers."

        "@value": "Gentamicin Protection Assay to Determine Bacterial Survival within Macrophages. Macrophages are key cells involved in orchestrating host defense against infections. Here, we describe the protocol for a bacterial killing assay in macrophages that can be adapted to any bacterial pathogen. Using this assay, we analyzed the survival of wild-type and mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) within RAW 264.7 cells, a widely used macrophage cell line. Bacterial mutants defective in intracellular survival within macrophages can be delineated using this assay.. Culture RAW 264.7 cells in RPMI1640 with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1x penicillin streptomycin and glutamine at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Count the cells using standard procedures and seed 2 x 105 RAW cells/well, by adding 1 ml per well in a 24 well plate. Set up 2 plates; one for T0 and another for T2 and incubate in a CO2 incubator. Start overnight cultures of CFT073 in 3 ml of LB broth in a 10 ml polypropylene tube and incubate at 37 °C shaking at 200 rpm. Use appropriate culture media when using other bacterial strains. Determine the multiplicity of infection (MOI = number of bacteria per RAW 264.7 cell) and alter the inocula preparation accordingly. For an MOI of 10, add 2 x 106 cfu of E. coli CFT073 for a well containing 2 x 105 RAW cells. Pellet the bacterial cells from the 3 ml culture by centrifuging at 4,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. Resupend the pellet in 3 ml PBS. Adjust the OD600 of broth culture to 4 in PBS, by measuring the optical density of a 1:10 diluted culture in a spectrophotometer and calculating the optical density of undiluted culture. Dilute 1:100 in PBS. Dilute 1:10 in RPMI 1640 without antibiotics. Wash RAW cells twice with PBS. Add 1 ml of diluted culture to each well; three technical replicates per sample and three biological replicates of the entire experiment are recommended. Use the same set up for T0 and T2 plates. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. Aspirate supernatant and wash 3 times with PBS. Add 1 ml of RPMI 1640 with gentamicin (200 µg/ml) per well. Incubate the T0 plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. Incubate the T2 plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h. After 15 min or 2 h, remove the supernatants entirely by aspiration. Lyse cells with 1 ml of filter sterilized 1% saponin in H2O per well by incubating for 10 min at room temperature followed by vigorous pipetting. Determine the extent of lysis using a standard inverted microscope. Plate undiluted and -2 dilution for T0 and T2 time points on LB plates. % Killing = [(T0-T2)/T0]*100."

        "@value": "Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (CM-H2DCFDA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cellular physiopathology. ROS are implicated in cell proliferation, signaling pathways, oxidative defense mechanisms responsible for killing of bacteria, thyroid hormonosynthesis, etc. The cellular Redox homeostasis is balanced by oxidants and antioxidants systems. In several diseases (cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases), the Redox balance is disturbed. In fact, excessive amounts of ROS can damage proteins, lipids and DNA at cellular level. The choose of a sensitive method for detection of intracellular ROS is very important for detecting the disturbed Redox balance in pathological cells and after exposition of cells to different genotoxic agents (Irradiation, Oxidative stress, etc).The detection of ROS in biological systems is difficult for several reasons: Method sensibility and probe specificity. The 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) fluorescent probe is commonly employed and may react with several ROS including hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. The cell-permeant H2DCFDA passively diffuses into cells and is retained in the intracellular level after cleavage by intracellular esterases. Upon oxidation by ROS, the nonfluorescent H2DCFDA is converted to the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The chloromethyl derivative of H2DCFDA (CM-H2DCFDA) provides much better retention in live cells than H2DCFDA. Dead or dying cells produces ROS. When we want to detect ROS in living cells, we have to stain cells by propidium iodide (PI) and evaluate ROS production only in living cells which are PI negative. In fact, PI intercalates into double-stranded nucleic acids. It is excluded by viable cells but can penetrate cell membranes of dying or dead cells. PI is excited at 488 nm and emits at a maximum wavelength of 617 nm. Because of these spectral characteristics, PI can be used in combination with other fluorescent probe such as CM-H2DCFDA (excitation/emission: 492–495/517–527 nm).A probe fluorescence emission can be assessed by Flow cytometry, a standard fluorometer or fluorescence microscopy using appropriate filter.Flow cytometry is commonly employed to detect intracellular ROS production. Flow cytometry measures fluorescence per cell. The cells is excited by the light source and emitted light from cells are converted to electrical pulses by optical detectors. Emitted Light is send to different detectors by using optical filters: 525 nm Band Pass Filter for FL-1 and 620 nm Band Pass Filter for FL-3. A 525 nm band pass filter (FL-1) placed in the light path prior to the detector will only allow “green” light into the detector. So, FL-1 is used in our protocol to collect green light corresponding to the oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) by ROS. FL-1 is the Green (FL-1) channel on flow cytometers. 620 nm Band Pass Filter (FL-3) only allow “red” light into the detector. Red fluorescence emission is measured in the Red (FL-3) channel on most flow cytometers.. HTori-3.1 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well into six-well plates in complete culture medium. Sixteen hours later, the cells (90% confluence) were washed by warm DPBS, harvested by trypsinization (250 μl of trypsin / Well). Add 1 ml of complete culture medium (10% FCS) to stop trypsinization and resuspend cells by gently pipetting up and down. Collect cells into 5 ml polystyrene round bottom tube by centrifugation (5 min at 200 x g) at room temperature and aspirate supernatant. Wash cell pellet with 4 ml DPBS and centrifuge 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature. Resuspend cell pellet in HBSS with 10 μmol/L of CM-H2DCFDA and increased concentration of H2O2 (1 – 5 -10 -15 - 20 - 25 and 50 μmol/L) by gently pipetting up and down (500 μl/tube). Incubate cells (resuspended in tubes) in cell incubator [(37 °C), high relative humidity (95%), and controlled CO2 level (5%)] in the dark for 45 min. Add Propidium Iodide 0.5 μl/0.5 ml/tube (final concentration = 1 μg/ml) and place the tubes on ice (still in the dark) and proceed immediately to flow cytometry analysis. Note that: a) the propidium iodide staining procedure should be performed immediately before analysis on the flow cytometer, b) when we place tubes on ice we minimize cell activity and we avoid artifactual fluctuations of ROS detection between the first tube analyzed in FACS and following tubes. A total of 5,000 events are analyzed in flow cytometry. The cellular viability is assessed by propidium iodide staining. Collect PI fluorescence in the FL-3 channel (620 nm) of FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Living cells, which are PI negative, were selected by FACS gating. In these living cells, we record the fluorescence of DCF on FL-1 channel (525 nm) of FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson).."

        "@value": "Electron Microscopy Sample Preparation Protocol Enabling Nano-to-mesoscopic Mapping of Cellular Connectomes and Their Habitats in Human Tissues and Organs. Multibeam scanning electron microscopy (multiSEM) provides a technical platform for seamless nano-to-mesoscale mapping of cells in human tissues and organs, which is a major new initiative of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Such cross-length-scale imaging is expected to provide unprecedented understanding of relationships between cellular health and tissue-organ as well as organismal-scale health outcomes. For example, understanding relationships between loss in cell viability and cell network connectivity enables identification of emergent behaviors and prediction of degenerative disease onset, in organs as diverse as bone and brain, at early timepoints, providing a basis for future treatments and prevention. Developed for rapid throughput imaging of minute defects on semiconductor wafers, multiSEM has recently been adapted for imaging of human organs, their constituent tissues, and their respective cellular inhabitants. Through integration of geospatial approaches, statistical and network modelling, advances in computing and the management of immense datasets, as well as recent developments in machine learning that enable the automation of big data analyses, multiSEM and other cross- cutting imaging technologies have the potential to exert a profound impact on elucidation of disease mechanisms, translating to improvements in human health. Here we provide a protocol for acquisition and preparation of sample specimen sizes of diagnostic relevance for human anatomy and physiology. We discuss challenges and opportunities to integrate this approach with multibeam scanning electron microscopy workflows as well as multiple imaging modalities for mapping of organ and tissue structure and function.. Sample sectioning and fixation Femoral neck and head samples are sourced from patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery. Cut the femoral head into three sections from proximal end to distal end with the precision cutter. Cut the medial and lateral portions into three pieces transversely across the bone with the precision cutter. Section tissue, with the saw microtome, into 1 mm thick section along the plane of interest, e.g., coronal or sagittal plane, to allow for infiltration of fixation and embedding chemicals. Fix the sectioned tissue immediately after with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer at room temperature for 5 days. Note: Tissue must be fully submerged in solution. Wash sample with cacodylate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.3) daily for 5 days. Note: Samples can be stored in cacodylate buffer for up to 2 weeks. Dehydration Dehydrate the sample in an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 75%, 95%) for 3 days each, changing daily. Place the sample in absolute ethanol for 3 days, changing daily. Embedding and polymerization Fill glass container with polymer. Insert specimen with section side of interest facing down. Cover with foil and place in explosion-proof refrigerator for 48 h. Periodically remove from refrigerator, checking orientation. Allow container to remain at room temperature (25 °C) until polymerization occurs (3-7 days). Once polymerization extends slightly above the specimen, check hardness with a teasing needle then place into a 60 °C incubator overnight to complete polymerization. Place specimen in plastic bag and strike the glass with a mallet to shatter it. Carefully remove block and rinse under running H2O. Trim excess plastic from block with bandsaw. Note: Embedded samples can be stored indefinitely before progressing to the following stages. Surface preparation Note: Choose option Step D1 if precision-CNC milling is available. Choose option Step D2 if precision CNC milling is not possible or semi-automatic and hand polishing is preferred. Precision CNC-milling of bulk embedded samples Fix the sample onto a CNC-lathe. Mill to require depth using a carbide insert without a honed edged facing the sample surface. Gently polish the sample surface with a soft microfiber cloth, acrylic polish and ultra-pure H2O. Flow ultra-pure H2O over the sample to clear of all polish and residue. Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe. Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen). Manual grinding and polishing Mount the 500-grit polishing disc on the polishing wheel. Start the polishing wheel at 200 rpm and place the surface face down with even pressure. Gradually resurface the sample using the 500-grit then lift from the wheel. Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner. Stop the wheel and then mount the 1,200-grit polishing disc. Start the polishing wheel at 200 rpm and place the surface face down with even pressure. Gradually resurface the sample using the 1,200-grit then lift from the wheel. Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner. Stop the wheel and mount the MD-Dac polishing pad and apply a small amount of 3 μm diamond suspension. Turn the polishing wheel to 200 rpm and spread the suspension across the polishing pad. Press the sample face down with even pressure and gently polish then lift from the wheel. Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner. Stop the wheel and mount the MD-Nap polishing pad and apply a small amount of 1 μm diamond suspension. Turn the polishing wheel to 200 rpm and spread the suspension across the polishing pad. Press the sample face down with even pressure and gently polish then lift from the wheel. Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner. Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe. Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen). Chemical etching Mount the sample onto the specimen holder, fixing it in place using silver paint (alternately carbon or copper tape may be used). Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe. Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen). Define edges of etched zone and protect areas unetched surfaces by covering with masking medium, leaving a large margin, i.e., electrical tape and/or finger nail polish. Pipette off 2 ml of HCl solution and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched. Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 60 s. Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with dust-free wipes. Pipette off 2 ml of HCl solution and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched. Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 25 s. Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with dust-free wipes. To remove flaked off organic material, pipette off 2 ml of NaClO and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched. Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 60 s. Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with absorbent, lint free wipes. Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe and if electrical tape has been removed, making sure to remove any adhesive residue. Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen). Place in a protective specimen storage box to prevent exposure to elements or dust prior to carbon sputtering and SEM imaging. Note: Samples can remain in storage indefinitely before proceeding to the following methods. Preparation of sample for imaging Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a dust-free wipe. Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen). Carbon-coat the sample with a 20 nm thick layer of film. Mount the specimen to the stage or metal stub using silver paint (alternately, carbon or copper tape can be used), ensuring an unbroken and robust connection is made between the sample surface and sample holder. Place the sample under vacuum in preparation for imaging in accordance to your electron microscopy system.. Connectomics refers to the mapping of cellular connectivity in a physiological context, e.g., in organs and organ systems (Sporns et al., 2005; Lichtman et al., 2008; Knothe Tate, 2017). Seamless, multiscale and multimodal imaging provides a platform for interdisciplinary research and the trans-dimensional linking of biological structure and function (Sporns et al., 2005; Lichtman et al., 2008; Eberle et al., 2015; Hageman et al., 2016; Knothe Tate et al., 2016a, 2016b and 2016c; Pereira et al., 2016; Knothe Tate, 2017; National Institutes of Health, 2018; https://www.humanconnectome.org/). The U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Connectome Project, launched in 2009, aimed to map \"the human brain...to connect its structure to function and behavior\" (https://www.humanconnectome.org/). In 2018, NIH debuted a program to promote cross-cutting research mapping the cells within the human body (National Institutes of Health, 2018). Connectome maps of brain and other tissues of the body have typically been restricted to small organisms due to challenges associated with cross-scale imaging from nano- to mesoscopic length scales. New imaging technology platforms enable such seamless scale-crossing image acquisition, and current barriers include biophysical hurdles intrinsic to specimen preparation as well as digital hurdles inherent to massive data management, analysis, and curation to maximize sharing across platforms and among geographically far flung users.Currently, there is a great imperative not only to study the cells themselves but also to refocus at the intersection of and across multiple length scales encompassing the cellular networks that inhabit complex biosystems comprising tissues, organs, and organ systems. The status of these organ connectomes provides a powerful early indicator of degenerative changes and disease states over the lifespan of the organism. Three-dimensional multiscale imaging methods allow unprecedented study of structure and function across length scales; from organ to tissue, cells to molecules (Anderson et al., 2008; Hageman et al., 2016; Knothe Tate et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2016).Traditional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), commonly used to visualize cellular ultrastructure, provides superior resolution and contrast. However, this is contingent on the often-laborious preparation of specimens into ultrathin sections (no more than 100 nm in thickness) for electron transparency.The emergence of multibeam scanning electron microscopy (multiSEM), with 61 or 91 parallel beams, is heralded by a new age of organ connectomics and presents a suitable platform for imaging large areas at nanometer resolution (Eberle et al., 2015; Knothe Tate et al., 2016a and 2016c; Hageman et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2016; Knothe Tate, 2017). The imaging rates and resolutions of multiSEM far supersede single-beam SEM, imaging an area of 1 cm2 at 4 nm pixel size in less than 3 h. It is able to image specimens reaching 10 cm in diameter at up to 4 nm resolution. Despite advances in the imaging technologies, biological tissue specimen preparation has remained unchanged for decades, and hinders translation to cutting-edge imaging modalities (multiSEM). This protocol addresses the difficulties associated with specimen preparation workflows enabling multiSEM, as well as multimodal and correlative imaging methods. While having been implemented successfully in peer-reviewed publications (Figure 1), details of the protocol have been requested by the medical and scientific community alike, providing impetus for its publication (Knothe Tate et al., 2004; Eberle et al., 2015; Knothe Tate et al., 2016b; Hageman et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2016).Figure 1. Cellular epidemiology studies in large scale maps comprising stitched, scanning electron microscopy images. These high-resolution images are obtained using multiSEM and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach that greatly expands beyond fields of view previously acquired using confocal scanning microscopy. A. Geonavigational methods and the Google Maps Javascript API were utilized to create navigable maps of osteocytes within the human hip imaged using multiSEM and spanning the nano- to mesoscale. The world's first map of the human hip was created by imaging a sample approximately 2.4 x 2.4 mm. Imaging using a 61-parallel-beam Zeiss MultiSEM 505 prototype yielded over 55,000 SEM images, which were stitched into a single image, and rendered in a pyramidal structure for seamless zooming into and out of the map using Google Maps API. The dark area in the middle of the sample is an artifact of automated polishing, a sample preparation step that was later changed to precision CNC milling and hand polishing (see Procedure section). B-C. Google Maps Javascript API enabled the geographic coordinates of physiologically relevant landmarks to be recorded. Blood vessel edges, viable osteocytes and pyknotic (sick) osteocytes were marked with blue, green and red pins respectively. D. The position of each pin could be exported for post hoc analyses, e.g., to test the hypothesis that cell viability correlates to blood vessel proximity, path lengths of viable, pyknotic (sick) and interstitial cells to blood vessels were calculated and compared. E. MultiSEM images of a viable cell, with projections emanating outwards into the matrix and pyknotic cell, no projections observed. F. The role of cell health and connectivity on tissue health was first observed in 3D images of osteocyte networks from (left) healthy, (middle) osteoporotic and (right) severely osteoporotic cortical bone from the femoral head of human patients, using laser scanning confocal microscopy. A shortcoming of this approach is that volumes of interest are limited to e.g., 274 x 274 x 50 microns. Figures adapted and used with permission. (Knothe Tate et al., 2004; Eberle et al., 2015; Knothe Tate et al., 2016c; Hageman et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2016).Presented in this protocol is a detailed workflow for sample preparation of sizeable tissue specimens (up to 10 cm in diameter, Figure 2) of human and large mammalian origin. The method has been tested in human samples from the femoral neck and head of subjects undergoing hip replacement (all human samples collected and used in development of this protocol complied with all relevant ethical regulations of the Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Clinic, IRB #12-335) as well from sheep (Ovis aries) femur and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) knee to verify multimodal imaging (all animal tissue samples used in development of this protocol derived from studies that adhered to protocols approved through the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees [IACUC] of the Canton of Grisons, Switzerland and Case Western Reserve University, in adherence with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments [ARRIVE] guidelines). Here we adapted methods typically used for TEM and SEM tissue sample preparation to enable across length scales, from nano- to mesoscopic. The methods integrate techniques including precision CNC-milling and chemical etching methods developed for atomic force microscopy to enable three dimensional and multimodal imaging. This method can be applied to macroscopic human tissues and tissues of large mammals and can be integrated into a multimodal imaging workflow, in particular correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM).Figure 2. Workflow for acquisition of multiSEM data using mesoscopic samplesComparison with other methodsThe key advantages of this method for biological specimen preparation are that it is streamlined yet maintains the flexibility to be applied to any tissue specimen using readily available materials (typically used in atomic force microscopy, EM and laser confocal microscopy specimen preparation). However, this flexibility and ease of implementation has its drawbacks, as the method is not entirely self-contained and the sample must be moved from platform to platform, if light microscopy is used in addition to EM. Advantageously, the use of heavy metal stains (uranyl acetate and lead citrate) are eliminated, as carbon sputtering provides sufficient contrast enhancement in the workflow. This further simplifies the process, avoiding the use of hazardous chemicals and their associated risks. Similarly, osmium tetroxide (OsO4) is not used in the fixation contrast as carbon sputtering alone provides sufficient contrast. This provides further advantages in context of multimodal, correlative microscopy, as OsO4 imparts a yellow hue throughout the specimen, impairing any form of light microscopy (Figures 2-4). This protocol is ideal for studies involving tissue samples from human or large mammals (up to 10 cm in diameter) where the organization of cells and tissues are of primary interest. While the resultant data encodes great structural detail, it is also extremely large (> 10 TB) and requires an appropriate and robust data management system or pipeline for efficient analytics and interpretation, which is outside the scope of traditional laboratory infrastructure. Considering the magnitude of data, it is improbable that analyses can be conducted using conventional means. This presents a disadvantage as well as an opportunity, i.e., through incorporation of cutting edge approaches including deep learning and machine learning, the economic and time costs of manual methods can be eliminated, providing a path to full automation in the future (Nathanson et al., 2019).Figure 3. Seamless multi-scale imaging of hip joint tissue, prior to etching step. A. Transmitted light image of OsO4 stained femoral head section, with greatest penetration of contrast agent (darkest) in cartilage (white dotted square) and marrow spaces of the subchondral bone (black dotted square). B. Subchondral bone exhibits less staining than cartilage and is highly cellular. Area corresponds approximately to black dotted square (in A). C. The tidemark, delineating the interface of unmineralized (rust-brown) and mineralized (orange) cartilage is visible in the upper right corner. Defects in the uncalcified cartilage are visible as light \"cracks\" running orthogonal to the tidemark line. Area corresponds approximately to the white dotted square (in A). Regarding suboptimal quality of images: these images are taken of a 300 μm thick, EPON® embedded, undecalcified section without prior mounting and cover slipping, using an inverted epifluorescent microscope with 1.6x (A) and 10x (B, C) dry objectives. Specimens were not mounted, or cover slipped due to plans to image subsequently using multiSEM. After completion of multiSEM studies, microradiography and renewed optical imaging can be carried out. D. Laser scanning confocal image of specimen shows autofluorescence (light areas) of subchondral bone and marrow spaces (ellipsoids) as well as cartilage (dark), with two visible cartilage defects (bright cracks, arrows). E. Large scale, tiled multiSEM image of same area with single field of view showing (sub-) cellular resolution of bone (F) and blood (G) cells without additional etching. H. Traditional SEM studies on specimens containing soft tissue reveal intertwining muscle fiber architecture.Figure 4. Seamless nano- to mesoscale imaging of the human hip, visualized using the Google Maps navigational platform. A. The Google Maps JavaScript API was used to visualize and create navigable maps of an imaged region. The arrowheads point to the eroded surface of the hip joint, toward areas internal to the femoral head. B. A single osteocyte on the sample surface with C. projections (osteocyte processes) into the underlying matrix. This sample was imaged using a 61- parallel-beam Zeiss MultiSEM.The choice of poly (methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) over epoxy, results in more resilient samples, with little damage observed after electron beam exposure. MultiSEM requires sample flatness and parallelism to the mount surface to prevent charging artifacts, which ideally requires precision CNC-milling, an unconventional technique for EM sample preparation. Similar results have been achieved with conventional polishing methods.The protocol does not involve ultra-thin sectioning characteristic of TEM, which is often difficult and time consuming. As a result, use of the method may not perfectly preserve or enable visualization of internal cellular ultrastructure. For ultrastructure studies, TEM resolutions remain superior to SEM. Neither this protocol method nor any electron microscopy method enables live-cell imaging and images represent single points in time. Hence, the method does not capture the nuance and temporal dynamic of complex biological processes.Novel techniques such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Tapia et al., 2012) and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) (Mikula and Denk, 2015) allow the three-dimensional visualization of and reconstruction of cellular ultrastructure, however samples are limited to a few millimeters on edge in size. Although the images acquired from this protocol are two-dimensional, they provide a birds-eye-view, at nanometer resolution, of cellular networks and populations over large areas. The method thus enables visualization of tissue architecture not readily achievable using two-dimensional EM.Experimental DesignFor each experiment, we defined the relevant research question and a testable hypothesis, relating independent variables (also referred to as outcome measures) as a function of dependent variables. Exclusion criteria were defined to reduce effects of unrelated disease states that could lead to misinterpretation of results, e.g., metabolic bone disease is excluded in a study of loss of bone density due to disuse.Power calculations were made to determine sample size for each experimental group. Some novel studies do not have a representative dataset upon which, variance measures can be made and initial sample sizes have to be based on previous experience. Power analyses conducted for previous studies determined the need for a sample size of 5 patients per cohort. Post hoc analyses on these data indicated the robustness of study outcomes; from a translational perspective, even if more than 700 patients were tested to obtain statistical significance, differences (in periosteum derived stem cell regenerative capacity attributable to age and/or disease state) would remain small, due to the small to medium effect size (of age and disease), even if significantly different (Chang et al., 2014).Specimen AcquisitionThe critical phase research requiring human tissue samples is the acquisition of specimens (Figure 5). It is crucial to find a surgeon willing and able to collaborate in the study, acting as not only clinical investigator on the ethics protocol but ensuring the identification and screening of possible participants, alongside ensuring informed consent is obtained for each individual involved. It is crucial all specimens are de-identified, by removing all identifying information such as name, medical patient numbers, etc. by the tissue procurement and/or pathology department of the clinic prior to release of the tissues for scientific research. Age and sex of the patient are retained in sample documentation. Together with date of acquisition, specimens are separately identifiable without access to medical documentation.In some experimental study designs, samples are given non-obvious identifiers and the key to decoding the identifiers is retained in a secure position by the clinical partner to enable later information from the patient's medical record, e.g., specific health history information, if needed. In obtaining patient consent while also striving to include diverse populations in cohorts, consideration should be made to patient groups whose beliefs may preclude sharing of tissues. It may be possible to encourage their inclusion through awareness of cultural sensitivities and inclusion of language that addresses culture-specific considerations in outreach brochures as well as informed consent documentation.Figure 5. Procedures for acquiring and handling human tissues. Two samples from different patients, acquired on the same afternoon. Femoral heads (see photo, rounded structures divided into two halves) were sectioned along the plane of interest, e.g., coronal or sagittal plane, to allow for infiltration of fixation and embedding chemicals. A-G. Work flow chart for sample acquisition, with chemicals indicated in blue.Sectioning and FixationWith samples of size larger than a millimeter on edge, it is important to take extra measures to ensure samples undergo adequate fixation before proceeding. In this protocol, we are limited to diffusion fixation; perfusion of fixatives is not an option in human tissues. The femoral head and neck are sectioned, with the precision cutter, from the proximal and distal end before further sectioning of the medial and lateral portions, transversely across the bone. Following this, 1 mm slices in the plane of interest are taken with the saw microtome, slices at this thickness allow the complete infiltration of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde fixatives in cacodylate buffer in a fume hood. The specimens are then washed in cacodylate buffer before sequential ethanol dehydration (30%, 50%, 75%, 95%).Contrast EnhancementBiological specimens for EM typically require post-fixation contrast enhancement to resolve subcellular detail. Contrast enhancing agents such as osmium tetroxide are commonly used but impart exogenous color throughout the entire sample, making it unsuitable for multimodal imaging (Figure 2). Heavy metal staining is another mode of contrast enhancement, whereby uranyl acetate and lead citrate are routinely employed. The use of heavy metals is a more labor intensive and hazardous process, which was not desirable. Additionally, uranyl acetate introduces instability into the sample, making it light and UV sensitive and prone to forming precipitates over time. Instead, we opted to highlight subcellular detail post hoc, with the use of both chemical etching (detailed below and adapted from protocols used for AFM) and carbon sputtering.Resin EmbeddingConventionally, biological specimens are embedded in epoxy resins for EM. Initial attempts at using epoxy, EPON®, proved unsuccessful as it is typically used for samples that are 1-2 mm on edge. Under inspection with a light microscope, the epoxy embedded specimens exhibited variations in surface topography of up to 100 μm making it unsuitable for multiSEM. The specimens exhibited incomplete and non-uniform resin polymerization, most likely caused by insufficient resin penetration in such large specimens. Additional contributing factors to poor polymerization, include insufficient time for immersion and perfusion, inadequate dilution steps and excessive resin viscosity, all resulting in poor resin infiltration into tissue pores, leaving residual ethanol and propylene oxide within the sample.Due to the difficulties encountered with EPON® and prior experience with PMMA, we used lower viscosity PMMA resin as the embedding medium. To ensure complete infiltration of the resin into tissue pores and uniformity of the sample surface, dehydration time was increased, and the tissues were bulk embedded under vacuum to enable gradual polymerization.Planarity and Sample SizeThe development of multiSEM enables rapid throughput of specimens that far exceed traditional dimensions, up to 100 x 100 x 30 mm. However, it requires specimens to be flat and parallel to the stage, with a surface flatness less than or equal to 500 nm per 100 μm (peak-to-peak). This minimizes edge effects and specimen damage resultant of increased electron emissions at high points in the surface topography.Initially, specimens were manually and semi-automatically mechanically ground and polished, with both methods exhibiting varying degrees of success. Automated polishing proved too aggressive, rapidly removing the sample surface. Conversely, manual polishing was not time effective and resulted in the emergence of microscopic cracks in the sample surface, most likely due to the release of residual stresses. These cracks could later cause edge effects along the edges of the crack, interfering with SEM imaging quality. We progressed to micro- CNC milling and manual buffing with acrylic polish, the sample surface was milled with a great level of precision without the introduction of surface cracks. Specimens were precision milled in a CNC-lathe using a carbide insert with the unhoned edge against the sample surface. Following this, the surface was lightly buffed with a soft microfiber cloth, acrylic polish and ultra-pure water.Chemical Etching and SEM PreparationAs noted above, this protocol does not use heavy metals based post-fixation contrast enhancement. Instead, chemical etching methods adapted from techniques developed for AFM were used to uncover underlying molecular detail and cellular networks (Reilly et al., 2001; Knapp et al., 2002). Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) enable controlled etching of the organic, collagen, and inorganic, apatite composite matrices, revealing cells and projections embedded in the extracellular matrix. This method also allows for selective etching of regions of interest by masking around areas to be etched with electrical tape (geometric shapes) or nail polish (free form regions). Following this step, the sample can be imaged with light microscopy. To increase sample conductance and contrast, the specimen requires a thin carbon coat (20 nm) before it can be imaged using SEM."

        "@value": "Optogenetic Food Odor Avoidance Assay. Appetite is tightly linked to the sensory experience of feeding, including the smell, taste, and sight of food. Sensory perception can affect the palatability of food, modulating appetite beyond homeostatic requirements. Hypothalamic neurons that govern feeding are responsive to sensory cues associated with food, including food odors. However, the circuit mechanisms by which sensory information is processed and relayed to feeding nodes to affect feeding behavior is not well understood. Recent work has identified a population of excitatory basal forebrain neurons that modulate potent appetite suppression, as well as respond to food-associated and innately aversive odorants. To investigate this circuitry, we stereotaxically targeted virus expressing Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin to the basal forebrain and implanted fiber optic cannulas over the injection site. Mice were allowed to recover and underwent training to form a passive association of chow with a unique monomolecular odorant. After training, mice were fasted overnight, and were then presented with both the food-associated odor as well as a similar, novel odor in zones of an arena with and without photostimulation. To evaluate whether stimulation of this circuitry influenced sensory modulation of feeding behavior, video recording and behavioral tracking analysis were used to compare time spent investigating either odor. Thus, this protocol provides a useful paradigm to assay the contribution of different circuits in appetitive and aversive behaviors.. Fiber optic creation (Figures 1A and 1B) Cut ~4-5 inches of the optic fiber, providing you with ample material to work with for your implant. Strip ~2” of optic fiber with T10S13 micro-strip stripping tool. The exact length doesn’t matter, as long as it’s longer than the length of the ceramic ferrule, which is 6.4 mm. Line the stripped part of fiber with the Bondic liquid plastic welder, and insert the optic fiber into the large bore side of the ceramic ferrule. Slide the stripped fiber through the ferrule until it naturally comes to a stop at the non-stripped portion of the fiber. Secure the optic fiber in the ceramic ferrule by curing the liquid plastic with UV light. This takes about 2 min. Cleave off the excess stripped fiber from the small-bore end of the implant using a diamond knife. To cleave, gently score the fiber perpendicular to the implant, and then pull off excess fiber using the bare fiber gripper. Cleave the optic fiber at the large bore end, which is the portion of the fiber optic that is inserted into the brain, to the correct length for your implant site using a diamond knife. Ensure the length is approximately 300 µm above the target brain region. In other words, the total length of the non-stripped fiber = x µm - 300 µm (where x is the appropriate target depth). For example, to target a region 3 mm ventral from the skull, the fiber optic should measure 2.7 mm. Measure the length accurately using a caliper. Best cleavage is obtained by gently scoring the fiber perpendicularly, and then pulling straight away from the cleavage site, causing the excess fiber to “pop” off. After cleavage, this end of the fiber should be a smooth, flat circle without shards or cracks. Poor cleavage will result in poor light output, as this end of the implant cannot be polished. Using a polishing disk and a hemostat to hold the implant in place, polish the ferrule tip (small-bore end) on polishing paper (placed on top of the rubber polishing mat) proceeding from high to low grit (30 µm down to 0.02 µm) in a Figure 8 motion. Spend about 1-2 min on each grit. The higher grit polish paper is used to fix and chips or shards in the fiber, creating a flat surface. Once the surface of the fiber is smooth and level, progress in descending grit order to continue polishing the fiber, ensuring maximum light output by going from a rough surface to a smooth surface. The small-bore end of the fiber should be very shiny and clear once it is properly polished. Confirm transmittance of the optic fiber. Check the shape of the laser beam and power output. The shape of the laser beam should be a circle, and if it is polished nicely you will even see concentric circles (Figure 1B). Depending on the light source/power used, the minimum light output should be 1 mW. You can check light output using an optical power meter. Figure 1. Fiber Optic implantation in Mouse. A. Ceramic ferrule orientation for optic fiber and example final optic fiber implant. B. Optimal laser beam shape after polishing is a clean circle with high light output, and if polished and cleaved well, contains concentric circles. In comparison, poor laser beam shapes are fuzzy or misshaped circles with lower light output. C. Mouse skull exposed with diagram indicating bregma and lambda for stereotaxic injection. D. Mouse with bilateral fiber optic implants, pink skull cap (acrylic), and metal holding bar (18G needle). Surgery preparation Sterilize surgery area using 70% ethanol, and sterilize surgical instruments using disinfectant (Germinator500) followed by 70% ethanol. Treat mouse with 5 mg/kg meloxicam and 10 mg/kg sterile saline subcutaneously 30 min prior to surgery. Repeat meloxicam injection every 24 h for a minimum of 72 h while monitoring animal for signs of pain or distress. Prepare your micropipette for injection. Pull a 3.5” glass pipette with a glass pipette puller, with the tip being about 1 cm long. Once pulled, snip off about 1 mm of the glass tip with surgical scissors to ensure the end of the tip is open. Back-fill the glass pipette using a MicroFil 28 gauge/67 mm needle and 1 ml syringe filled with sterile mineral oil to prevent contamination, and load the pipette onto the Nanoject II. Empty the pipette of mineral oil and then re-fill with the desired volume of virus, depending on your region of interest. Small regions may require as little as 20 nl, while larger regions may require 500 nl or more. Weigh the mouse and sedate with sufficient isoflurane (1-4% isoflurane diluted in 100% oxygen), monitoring vitals of the animal. Shave the mouse’s scalp and clean with alcohol/povidone-iodine swab (70% and 10% respectively). Place the animal on the stereotaxic rig by hooking their front incisor teeth into the mouth bar. Straighten the animal, and then fix the ear bars into the ear canals. Once secure, tighten the nose bar firmly over the nose, without blocking airflow. Maintain the animal under anesthesia using 1-3% isoflurane diluted with 100% oxygen using a Vetequip vaporizer. The dosage of isoflurane depends on the physiological state of the animal as monitored by response to tail pinch. Maintain proper thermoregulation during surgery by using a heat pad set to 37 °C. Apply ophthalmic ointment to mouse’s eyes to prevent dryness and discomfort during surgery. Viral vector injection (Figure 1C) Make an incision in the scalp with surgical scissors at the posterior end of the brain, and cut anteriorly towards the olfactory bulb in a straight line. Use bulldog clamps to pull the skin away from the skull, exposing the skull. Keep the skull moist during surgery with sterile saline. To calibrate the Leica Angle Two Stereotax system, locate Bregma and then lower the tip of the micropipette, mounted onto the Nanoject II on the stereotaxic holder, to rest lightly on it. Then click “at Bregma” in the software. After identifying Bregma, raise the needle, and check the z coordinates by moving 1.5 mm to the left and right of Bregma, lowering the micropipette to touch the skull carefully, and take note of the z coordinate. The skull will need to be adjusted until the tilt is level, with a margin of error of ± 0.03 mm. After establishing the medial-lateral axis using Bregma, Lambda is used to establish the anterior-posterior axis. Once again, lower the micropipette to lambda and take note of the z coordinate. Adjust the skull until the dorsal/ventral coordinates of Lambda and Bregma are within ± 0.03 mm of each other, selecting “At Lambda” once level. Identify your injection site using coordinates from the Allen Brain Atlas (installed in the Leica Angle Two software). It is best to validate coordinates empirically before beginning an experiment. Make a small burr hole craniotomy (< 1 mm) over the injection site using a hand-held dental drill with a 0.5 mm drill bit. Clear bits of skull away from the center of the craniotomy. Lower the micropipette slowly to the injection site (~3 mm/min) and upon arrival at the target site, wait 5 min before injecting virus to allow the brain to settle. Inject discrete volumes of virus every 30 s (100 nl or less) using the Nanoject II. Once the total volume of virus has been injected, wait another 5 min before slowly raising the needle out of the brain. Note: Ensure that the micropipette does not become clogged or break during the surgery. To check for a clogged micropipette, eject a small volume of virus before lowering the micropipette into the brain, and ensure that virus flows out of the micropipette. If no virus appears, snip the end of the micropipette and re-calibrate Bregma. If you are doing bilateral injections, repeat Procedure C for the opposite side. Keep skull moist during injections using sterile saline. Fiber implantation Remove the Nanoject II from the stereotaxic frame and attach a stereotaxic cannula holder onto frame. Etch a checkered pattern on skull surface with a 28 gauge needle. This “scoring” of the skull increases surface area for cement to bind, increasing durability of the implant. Wash any debris away with sterile saline and dry thoroughly. The skull must be dry for cement to bind. Insert the fiber optic cannula into the cannula holder. Locate Bregma with the fiber optic implant and select “At Bregma” once more. Then go to the coordinates of your injection site. If the fiber optic implant site is different from the injection site, drill holes over the target stimulation site(s). Lower the fiber optic implant to the target stimulation site. Lower the implant at a slow rate of 1-2 mm/min. In one well of a cold ceramic plate, place 4 drops of Metabond solvent and 1 drop of Metabond catalyst and mix well. Apply the liquid solution from well #1 to the base of the ceramic ferrule and the skull surface using a sterile applicator. In another well (#2), place 4 drops of Metabond solvent, 2 scoops of Metabond cement powder, and 1 drop of Metabond catalyst. Mix well. Apply a thin, even layer of dental cement (well #2) across the skull and lower portion of the implant, creating support around the base of the implant. Continue applying even layers until the cement in well #2 is used up. Allow dental cement to dry completely. Repeat Steps D3-D10 for the second implant if doing bilateral implants. Note: You will not be able to re-establish Bregma; thus, guide the implant through the second craniotomy and calculate the required distance in the z direction to reach the stimulation target using the Angle 2 software. Cut an 18 gauge needle to 1.5 cm in length using wire cutters at each end. Squeeze ends with a plier to dull them. Combine liquid and powder components of cross-linked flash acrylic to create a liquid jelly. Apply a final, even acrylic layer over the dental cement, ensuring the implants are well-secured. Build a mound of acrylic at the posterior end of the skull, placing the clipped 18 gauge needle at this position and securing it in place with further layers of acrylic. This will allow you to use ring-end forceps to grasp the mouse without having to scruff the animal (Figure 1D). Allow the mouse to recover in a clean cage on a heating pad. Monitor the animal every 15 min for 4 h, looking for signs of pain or distress. If they are not recovering as expected, euthanize humanely. Passive odor association After one day of recovery, begin passive odor association, which is where mice learn to associate food with a specific odorant. Choose two odors to be used in the experiment: one for association with food, and the other one as a novel odorant that will serve as a control during testing. If possible, you may want to choose an odor that has an enantiomer and is neither appetitive, nor aversive, or a “neutral” odorant (Devore et al., 2013). One good odor pair is R and S-Limonene, which are enantiomers. Methyl and ethyl acetate may also work well, as they have similar structures and are relatively neutral. Dissolve odorant to be associated with food in 5 ml of mineral oil to create a 2% by volume odor mixture. Mineral oil is odorless, so it is only used to dilute the concentrated odorant. Using a dropper, place 2 ml of odor mixture onto roughly 15 g of mouse chow pellets. Add odor-spiked chow to feeding hatch, or wherever the mouse normally receives food. Change out food with fresh odorant every 2 days, repeating for a total of 2 weeks. Use the same odorant throughout the training process. House mice in their normal home cage during this association process. Behavior assay habituation–6 days Note: This can be completed during passive food odor association. Create a behavior box (11 x 11x 12 inches) with 4 corners containing a 1.5 ml tube secured to the wall with tape (Figure 2B). Place a cotton swab in each 1.5 ml tube (you may need to alter the length to fit in the 1.5 ml tube). (Figure 2A) Place animals in the behavior box arena for 30 min for 3 days. Place animals in the behavior box arena for 30 min for 3 days while being tethered to fiber optic patch cords. Figure 2. Behavior box construction. A. Cotton swab trimmed to the appropriate length and placed in a 1.5 ml tube for future odor presentation. B. Four odor presentation tubes taped to the 4 corners of a square behavior box. Behavior assay testing (Figure 3) Figure 3. Behavior testing paradigm. Testing paradigms indicating odor placement and photostimulation for each scenario. For the testing phase, you will compare the time optogenetically-implanted mice spend investigating the food-associated odor with and without photostimulation. This is to observe the effect of activating a neuronal population of interest on food odor processing, as food odors are normally appetitive. As a control, animals are also presented a novel, non-trained odor during photostimulation, to ensure that the difference in investigation time during photostimulation is specific to food odors alone. For testing, divide mice into 2 groups: Group A and Group B. Group A animals will go through testing in order 1, 2, 3, while group B will go in reverse order 3, 2, 1. This is to prevent habituation to odors. Randomize mice to these two groups by numbering mice and using a randomization generator (available in Graphpad). Have a labmate number each mouse so that the experimenter is blind during the experiment and analysis. Mice are fasted overnight prior to testing and are allowed to rest for 5 min in the behavior arena between testing scenarios. Test Scenario #1 Cotton Swabs are dipped in mixture of mineral oil + food associated odor (2% by volume) and placed in 3 of the 4 tubes. One tube has a cotton swab dipped in mineral oil only, which is the odorless control. Mice are attached to patch cords and placed in the behavior arena for 10 min while being video recorded. Test Scenario #2 Same as #1 however mice are photostimulated at a frequency ideal for activation of the neuronal population of interest. Mice are video recorded for 10 min during this photostimulation. Test Scenario #3 Same as scenario #2, however three cotton swabs are dipped in 2% mixture by volume of a novel, non-conditioned odorant. It may be helpful to choose an odorant that is similar to the food-associated odor. Mice are video recorded for 10 min during this photostimulation. During all scenarios, video record mice for post-hoc tracking analysis. Utilize a minimum video recording rate of 4 Hz. Higher rates can be used for finer detection, but will require greater computer memory and processing power. Ensure cages are evenly lit and videos have enough contrast that mice can easily be seen and that there are no large shadows in the cages.. Sensory cues can dramatically influence feeding behavior. Apart from taste, olfaction is a predominant sensory modality in feeding. The scent of food can override homeostatic mechanisms to influence or diminish the drive to eat (Li and Liberles, 2015). Furthermore, olfaction has been shown to impact both food intake and metabolism (Riera et al., 2017). Interestingly, hypothalamic feeding-associated regions–such as the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)–are modulated by olfactory perception of food (Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Jennings et al., 2015). Connected brain regions also integrate sensory information to regulate feeding. These regions include the anterior portion of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), hindbrain (including the nucleus tractus solitarius), parabrachial nucleus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Waterson and Horvath, 2015; Rossi and Stuber, 2018). However, the circuit mechanisms by which olfactory information is relayed to the hypothalamus and other feeding-associated nodes are not well understood. To interrogate the circuitry relaying sensory cues to the hypothalamus, we must be able to manipulate circuit activity in a cell-type specific manner. Previous experiments have utilized a variety of methods to manipulate neurons to assay food intake such as toxin mediated ablation, and chemogenetics (Luquet et al., 2005; Herman et al., 2016; Stamatakis et al., 2016). Optogenetics allows for precise spatial and temporal control of neuronal activity when combined with conditional viral genetic approaches (Adamantidis et al., 2007; Jennings et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2019). Previous optogenetic assays have shown particular neural circuits are capable of modulating food intake and appetitive behaviors, however, they do not investigate the sensory component of feeding behaviors (Jennings et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2016). To investigate how activation of basal forebrain neurons leads to hypophagia, we utilized optogenetics to activate the basal forebrain while recording how mice responded to food and food-associated odors (Patel et al., 2019). In this assay, optogenetic implanted mice were initially trained to form a passive association between a novel, neutral odorant and food. After training, animals were presented with the food-associated odor without photostimulation (stimulation control trial), the food-associated odor with photostimulation (experimental trial), or a completely novel odor with photostimulation (odor control trial). The odors were placed in three corners of a rectangular arena, leaving one corner empty. Additionally, mice were video-recorded, and these videos were analyzed post-hoc with video-tracking software to calculate the amount of time mice spent in each corner of the arena (Ben-Shaul, 2017). This allowed us to identify how a group of neurons mediated appetite suppression due to an aversion of food and food-associated sensory cues (Patel et al., 2019)."

        "@value": "In vitro Assays for Measuring Endothelial Permeability by Transwells and Electrical Impedance Systems. Vascular leakage is an important feature in several diseases, such as septic shock, viral hemorrhagic fever, cancer metastasis and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Thus establishing assays for measuring endothelial permeability will provide insight into the establishment or progression of such diseases. Here, we provide transwell permeability assay and electrical impedance sensing assay for studying endothelial permeability in vitro. With these methods, the effect of a molecule on endothelial permeability could be defined.. Transwell permeability assay Grow 2 x 105 HMEC-1 cells in 300 µl endothelial growth medium on the membrane of each 6.5 mm transwell insert (Figure 1). Figure 1. A schematic outline procedure and typical results of transwell permeability assay Fill the 24-well plate with 1 ml endothelial growth medium. Transfer the inserts to the wells with medium by using forceps, and then cover the plate with the lid. The sterilization of the forceps is not necessary, although treating with 80% ethanol is recommended. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for two days. Aspirate the medium from the top and bottom chamber, then replace with the same volume of fresh Medium 200 medium as described above. Note: Every movement in this step should be done carefully and slowly as to not activate the endothelial cells. Pipet tips should not touch the membrane. Refill the chambers with fresh medium in a dropwise manner to avoid shear flow. Put the plate back into the 37 °C incubator for another two days. Move the inserts to empty wells with forceps, and wait for 5 min to observe whether medium from the upper chambers leaks into the lower chamber. If there is no leak, then proceed to the next steps. If there is a leak repeat steps A6-A7 and wait till the cells are confluent. The endothelial cells must be fully confluent to ensure the formation of cell-cell junctions and a good endothelial barrier. In general, the cells form confluent monolayer after 5 days of incubation. Repeat step A5 and add the desired stimulation to the medium in the top chambers. The stimulation can be cytokines (TNF-α), molecules which induce inflammatory responses (lipopolysaccharide, histamine), or recombinant proteins (thrombin, dengue virus nonstructural protein 1). Incubate the plate in the 37 °C incubator for desired time period. This assay works best when the cells are stimulated between 10 min to 24 h. Here we show the result of stimulating the endothelial cells with thrombin for 30 min (Figure 1). Before measuring the permeability of the endothelial monolayer, prepare medium containing streptavidin-HRP (15 µl streptavidin-HRP per 1 ml of serum-free medium). Aspirate medium in top chambers and refill them with streptavidin-HRP-containing medium. Note: As mentioned in step A6, every movement should be gentle and careful, and pipet tips should not touch the membrane. Add 1 ml serum-free medium in each well of a new 24-well plate. And then put the inserts in. Cover the plate, and place the plate in the 37 °C incubator. After incubation for 5 min, the inserts are removed, and 20 µl of media from the lower chamber is transferred to a new 96-well plate. Every condition should be aliquoted in triplicate. Add 50 µl TMB substrate into each well of the 96-well plate, and wait 5 min at room temperature for the reaction to stabilize. After incubation, TMB substrate should turn blue. If there is no change in the color, extend the incubation time. However, the incubation time should not exceed 20 min. Add 25 µl stop solution into each well, and acquire the absorption at 450 nm with an ELISA reader. A schematic outline procedure and typical results are shown in Figure 1. RTCA Grow 1 x 104 HMEC-1 cells in each well of a 96-well E-plate, and fill the well with 100 µl of endothelial growth medium. Place the plate in the xCELLigence RTCA System, which is set up in a 37 °C incubator. Set the program to detect the resistance every hour and monitor when the cells have grown to confluency. In general, the cells grow to confluency after incubating for 2 days, so we suggest checking the cell index curve after 36 h of incubation. After the cell index curve stabilizes, refresh the medium, and wait 2 h for the cell index curve to stabilize again. Add the desired stimulation into each well. Every condition should be done in triplicate. Put the plate back into the xCELLigence RTCA System in the 37 °C incubator. Set up the desired detection period and time interval, and start the recording. The typical results of RTCA are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Thrombin-induced endothelial permeability increase as detected by RTCA. The endothelial barrier is a well-regulated structure, which maintains a minimal and selective permeability to fluid and molecules under normal physiological conditions (Komarova and Malik, 2010). The disruption of the endothelial barrier occurs during exposure to inflammatory cytokines, pathogen infection, or cancer metastasis, which induces the disruption of cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction, or cell-to-matrix attachments. The increase in vascular permeability is an important feature in many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis, viral hemorrhagic fevers and cancers. To screen which molecules modulate vascular permeability, it is necessary to establish in vitro systems to test endothelial permeability before expanding to animal studies. There are two available systems to test endothelial permeability in vitro, transwell permeability assay and electrical impedance sensing devices (Bischoff et al., 2016). The transwell permeability assays directly detect the penetration of macromolecules and the electrical impedance sensing devices measure the cell layer’s tightness for ion flow. Basically, molecules which can be detected by a spectrometer-based absorbance reader can be used in the transwell permeability assay. As a result, the materials required for this assay are relatively easy to prepare. For the electrical impedance sensing assay, we used the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) systems to measuring endothelial permeability in a 96-well microplate. Compared to transwell permeability assay, electrical impedance sensing device is more sensitive, and is suitable for time-lapse tracking. However, it is also more expensive, and it may not accurately reflect the penetration of molecules through cell-cell junction. As a result, it is more accurate to apply both systems in parallel. Here, we show the protocol for using these two methods to measure the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro (Chen et al., 2016)."

        "@value": "Infectious Focus Assays and Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) Calculations for Alpha-herpesviruses. Titration of viral stocks is a critical process before any experimental use of the virus. Here we describe an infectious focus assay for several alphaherpesviruses, a titration method for fluorescently labeled viruses, based on the original plaque assay. In addition, the calculation of multiplicity of infection (MOI) is presented.. Cell-associated varicella zoster virus (VZV) Grow MeWo or ARPE19 cells in a 24 well plate until they reach 90% confluence (~300,000 or 200,000 cells/well when seeding ~24 h before the infection, respectively). Use 500 µl/well volume to grow and infect the cells. The use of MeWo cells for VZV is documented in Heineman and Cohen (1994), Eisfeld et al. (2007) and Markus et al. (2011). Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of VZV-infected MeWo cells. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 10-1 to 10-6 of the initial stock. The volume inoculated to each well can range up to 500 µl. Add the infected cells to the 24-well plate containing the 90% confluent naïve cell cultures in triplicate and incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h. There is no special need to replace the medium after the addition of the inoculum, therefore the infected-cells can be left overnight as well. No agar overlay is required as no secondary plaques are formed by VZV, which does not release virions into the overlaying medium. Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 2-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software. If all fluorescent foci have developed into plaques then units used for the final virus concentration are plaque forming units (PFU). To calculate the PFU/ml, use the average number of foci in the wells with an input virus dilution resulting in 10-100 foci. For example, if the 10-3 dilution resulted in 24, 26 and 30 fluorescent foci per well, and the inoculated amount was 100 µl, then the stock concentration is Cell-free VZV Grow ARPE19 cells in a 24 well plate until they reach 90% confluence (~200,000 cells/well when seeding ~24 h before the infection). These cells are more easily infected at low VZV concentrations as compared to MeWo or MRC5 cells (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 2008; Pasdeloup et al., 2013). Use 500 µl/well volume to grow and infect the cells. Prepare 5-fold serial dilutions of cell-free VZV in high glucose DMEM. In our experience, diluting the virus in growth medium for cells which are not sensitive to the presence of serum does not seem to affect viral infectivity. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 1:5 to 1:625 of the initial stock. Inoculate the ARPE19 cells with 100-150 µl/well of the viral dilutions in triplicates. In a CO2 incubator, let the virus adsorb to the cell monolayer for 2 h, agitating occasionally. Remove the inoculum and add 0.5 ml pre-warmed growth media per well. No agar overlay is required since no secondary plaques are formed by VZV, which does not release virions into the overlaying medium. Monitor the cells for fluorescent foci formation. Usually, 5 days are sufficient for the foci to be easily countable, but this can vary between viruses and experiments. Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 3-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software. If all fluorescent foci have developed into plaques then units used for the final virus concentration are PFU. To calculate the PFU/ml, use the average number of foci in the wells with an input virus dilution resulting in 10-100 foci. For example, if the 1:25 dilution resulted in 25, 26 and 30 fluorescent foci, and the inoculate was 100 µl, then the stock concentration is Cell-free PRV and HSV1 Grow Vero cells (green African monkey kidney cells) in a 24 well plate until they reach 90% confluence (~400,000 cells/well when seeding ~24 h before the infection). The use of Vero cells for HSV1 and PRV is documented in Moffat et al. (1998), Nicola and Straus (2004) and Pasdeloup et al. (2013). Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus in high glucose DMEM. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 10-2 to 10-7 of the initial stock. Keep the dilutions on ice. Inoculate the Vero cells with 100 µl/well of the virus in quadruplicates. Let the virus adsorb to the cell monolayer for 1 h in a CO2 incubator, agitating every 15 min. Remove the inoculum and cover the cells with 1 ml of overlaying medium containing 0.3% agarose per well. Work quickly so that the media will not start to solidify before its addition to the cells. Monitor the cultures for formation of fluorescent foci, usually less than 4 days. Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 3-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software. If all fluorescent foci have developed into plaques then units used for the final virus concentration are PFU. To calculate the PFU/ml, use the average number of foci in the wells with an input virus dilution resulting in 10-100 foci. For example, if the 10-4 dilution resulted in 40, 43 and 45 fluorescent foci per well, and the inoculated amount was 100 µl, then the stock concentration is If virus without fluorescent label are used, or it is desirable to count plaques rather than fluorescent loci, plaques are visualized by staining cultures with 0.1% crystal violet: Carefully lift the overlaying agar medium using a spatula, taking care to not disturb the cell monolayer. Fix the cells with 100 µl 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Wash twice with PBS, and add 0.1% crystal violet solution for 10 min. Carefully wash with water until the liquid no longer has traces of blue (usually about 5 rinses). Count the plaques and calculate the PFU/ml as above. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) calculation In general, the equation of the multiplicity of infection is the following: In order to calculate the MOI, you should first determine the number of cells you are infecting, and the titer of the virus inoculated on them. For example, if 2.5 x 104 human foreskin fibroblasts are seeded in each well of a 24 well-plate, and 250 µl of 104 PFU/ml VZV were used to infect it, the MOI is."

        "@value": "PEG-mediated, Stable, Nuclear and Chloroplast Transformation of Cyanidioschizon merolae. The ability to achieve nuclear or chloroplast transformation in plants has been a long standing goal, especially in microalgae research. Over past years there has been only little success, but transient and stable nuclear transformation has been achieved in multiple species. Our newly developed method allows for relatively simple transformation of Cyanidioschizon merolae in both nuclear and chloroplast genome by means of homologous recombination between the genome and a transformation vector. The use of chloramphenicol resistance gene as the selectable marker allows for plate-based efficient selection of mutant colonies. Overall, the method allows the generation of mutant strains within 6 months.. C. merolae standard growth conditions Standard growth medium is MA2 Allen medium (Recipe 2). We suggest preparation of 10x concentrated stock solution of MA2 with A2 trace elements, without A2 Fe-EDTA and autoclave it. For every new preparation of culture medium, dilute an appropriate volume. After autoclaving add A2 Fe-EDTA (Recipe 4). The cultures should be grown in a transparent sterile vessel, of at least five times larger volume than the cell culture (e.g., 50 ml cultures in 250 ml flasks). Cultures must be gently agitated (30-50 rpm on an orbital shaker). Cultures must be sterile so any culture vessel must be closed off but it must allow for gas exchange. Atmospheric CO2 is sufficient for growth, but up to 5% CO2 in air can be applied. The light intensity should be in the range between 50 and 100 µmoles photons m-2 s-1 of continuous illumination. Growth rates are similar in the temperature range of 37-42 °C. OD of C. merolae should be kept between 0.01 and 1 at most. We advise to refresh every culture weekly or biweekly by inoculation of fresh culture out of 1/100 of the volume of the old culture. PEG transformation of C. merolae cells Set up at least (work in duplicates) 2x 50 ml culture of OD750 = 0.1 a week prior to transformation and allow it to grow in the standard conditions up to OD750 = 0.4. Two days before transformation, introduce a photoperiod of 8/16 ho light/dark. One hour before transformation expose to standard light conditions (if the dark period isn’t completed). Spin down 100 ml of culture at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the pellet in 50 ml of MA-1 solution at 40 °C and spin down again at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of MA-1 solution at 40 °C (now ready for transformation). Produce large quantity (above 50 μg and high concentration (above 200 ng/μL, measure precisely on NanoDrop) of transformation vector. Dilute the transformation vector to 20 μg in total 400 μl MA-1 buffer. Add 100 μl of the cell suspension to 400 μl of DNA and gently mix it by pipetting it up and down 2-3 times. Add 500 μl of 60% sterile PEG and gently mix it with the tip (the final concentration of PEG should be 30%). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer the cell suspension to 50 ml MA2 and spin down at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min, repeat one more time. Resuspend in 50 ml of MA2 medium and apply standard growth conditions. Allow growing under continuous light for 3 days, after that introduce selectable conditions–chloramphenicol at 150 μg/ml form freshly prepared stock solution of 100 mg/ml. Culture should fade (slowly turn yellow/white) and then regain growth (by appearance of green color). After 2-3 weeks, transfer 500 μl of the culture into 50 ml of MA2 medium in 250 ml flask. Plate 50 μl of culture on 1% (w/v) agar-solidified MA2 Petri dishes, seal 3 times with parafilm to avoid excessive evaporation and drying out of the medium matrix. Allow growing in standard conditions until colonies appear. Pick 20-50 colonies and transfer into a 250 ml flask with 50 ml of MA2 containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After it grows up to OD750 = 0.4, then inoculate into MA2 media with150, 200 and 250 μg/ml of chloramphenicol, respectively. Allow it to grow for ~2 weeks up to OD750 ~0.5. Inoculate new cultures from the successful, highest-concentration-of-chloramphenicol-grown surviving culture. Repeat as long as necessary to achieve and confirm homogeneity by appropriate genetic means (e.g., by qPCR specific to WT and modified genomes, Southern Blott The time needed for the entire procedure may vary and typically takes about 6 months).. Cyanidioschizon merolae 10D is a small single-cell eukaryotic red algae, that inhabits acidic hot springs. Lately, all three of its genomes were sequenced: nucleus (Matsuzaki et al., 2004), mitochondrion (Ohta et al., 1998), and plastid (Ohta et al., 2003). Its simple cell anatomy, the presence of a single mitochondrion and chloroplast, a highly reduced spliceosome (Stark et al., 2015), almost deprived of introns nuclear genome make this organism a suitable candidate for a model organism in broad range of plant research, from cell and plastid anatomy, through physiology and up to genetic engineering (Kuroiwa et al., 1998; Nozaki et al., 2003). Its simplicity makes it particularly useful for genetic manipulations. Thus, many genetic techniques have been applied and optimized, for this organism, including antisense suppression, transient expression, gene disruption, and stable insertion into the nuclear genome (Newell, 2000; Walker et al., 2005; Hallmann, 2007; Minoda et al., 2004; Ohnuma et al., 2008; Imamura et al., 2009; Ohnuma et al., 2009; Imamura et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011, Zienkiewicz et al., 2017a). Recently, also stable transformation of the chloroplast genome has been achieved (Zienkiewicz et al., 2017b; Zienkiewicz et al., 2018) in our laboratory. The developed method takes advantage of double homologs recombination in C. merolae, allowing for integration of foreign DNA into the genome in specific regions. A gene knock-out mutation replaces or disrupts the gene of interest with the cat (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Zienkiewicz et al., 2017a) gene under the original promoter or any familiar nuclear or chloroplast promoter (Krupnik et al., 2018). Promoters driving the transcription of the cat gene should exhibit at least moderate to significant constitutive activity; therefore application of promoters already tested is advised (Krupnik et al., 2018). By introducing Diphtheria toxin (fragment A-DTA) under a constitutive promoter into the transformation vector we managed to virtually exclude the possibility of random, illegitimate recombination events (Zienkiewicz et al., 2018). A single recombination event, random integration or otherwise unspecific incorporation of the transformation vector into the nuclear genome would likely cause expression of the A-DTA protein and in effect results in cell lysis. However, the heterogeneity of chloroplast transformation still remains a challenge. We have shown that continued growth of chloroplast mutants in increasing concentration of chloramphenicol allows in principal for reduction of heterogeneity and selection of homogenous mutants. Chloramphenicol is the only antibiotic that is toxic to C. merolae (out of c.a. 10 tested, Zienkiewicz et al., 2017a). This method is just as simple as application of lipofectamine for DNA delivery and is as efficient as the gene-gun method but without its drawbacks and complexity (Zienkiewicz et al., 2017b)."

        "@value": "In vitro Protein Ubiquitination Assays. Ubiquitin can be added to substrate protein as a protein tag by the concerted actions of ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). At the present of E1 and ubiquitin, E2 activity can be determined by the thio-ester formation. The E3 activity of a putative protein as well as the E2/E3 or E3/substrate specificities also can be explored by in vitro ubiquitination assay. The result can be detected by western blot with certain antibody. Purified proteins expressed from bacterial system are always used in this assay.. DTT sensitive thio-ester assay of E2 protein The reaction is performed in total 30 μl, including 1.5 μl of 20x buffer, 50 ng of E1, 200-500 ng E2, and 2 μg ubiquitin. Incubate the reactions at 37 °C for 5 min. Split the reactions by adding 10 μl 4x SDS sample buffer with or without DTT (or β- mercaptoethanol). Boil the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction products are separated with 12% SDS-PAGE gel and detected by Western blotting with anti-ub antibody or antibody for certain tag fused with the E2 protein to detect the formation of DTT-sensitive thio-ester bonds. The sample proteins separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gel are electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 75 min. The membrane is blocked with 1x PBS containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated first with primary antibody (suggested dilution ratio: 1:5,000 for anti-Ub, 1:500 for anti-His, 1:500 for anti-MBP antiserum) then with secondary antibody diluted in 1x PBS containing 3% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the membrane with 1x PBS for two times (15 min each) after it was incubated with the primary and secondary antibody. If detect His tagged protein with Nickel-HRP，just incubate the membrane with 1:15,000 dilution of Nickel-HRP in 1x PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h, wash the membrane two times and then bands can be detected. Bands were detected with the Millipore chemiluminescent HRP substrate kit. (Figure 1) Figure 1. DTT sensitive thio-ester assay of His-UBC3 ((Kraft et al., 2005)). The reaction samples were detected with anti-His antibody. The arrows indicate the DTT-sensitive thioester linkage. The open triangles indicate bands of E2 protein itself that was not attached to Ub. Asterisks indicate His-tagged Ub. Autoubiquitination assay of E3 protein The E3 proteins can be purified in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube from cell crude extract just before use (recombinant MBP (Maltose binding protein)-E3 protein is used as an example below). Vortex and thoroughly suspend the amylose beads. Aliquot 100 μl of bead suspension to a sterile microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 ml of MBP column buffer and resuspend the beads. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 2 min and decant supernatant. Repeat wash. Add 0.5-1 ml of crude extract (the total amount of the E3 protein should be 0.5-1 μg) to the tube containing the prewashed beads. Rotate at room temperature for 1 h (or 4 °C for 2 h). Wash the beads with 1 ml of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) for three times (like steps B3-4) and remove all the liquid of the final wash using very thin tips. Prepare the reactions in total 30 μl, including 1.5 μl of 20x reaction buffer, 50 ng of E1, 200–500 ng of E2, and 5 μg of ubiquitin. Add the reaction system to the tubes containing the amylose resin beads binding with MBP-E3 proteins. The reactions minus E1 and minus E2 respectively should be performed at the same time as control. Incubate the reactions at 30 °C for 1.5 h with agitation (900 rpm) in a thermomixer. Split the reactions by adding 10 μl 4x SDS sample buffer (with DTT or β- mercaptoethanol) and boil the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction products are separated with 8–12% SDS-PAGE gel and detected with anti-ubiquitin antibody or antibody for certain tag fused with ubiquitin or anti-MBP antibody by Western blotting. (see steps A5a-d) (Figure 2) Figure 2. E3 ligase autoubiquitination activity of MBP-SDIR1 (Zhang et al., 2007). ). MBP-SDIR1 was assayed for E3 activity in the presence of E1 (from wheat), E2 (UBCH5b) and 6x His tagged ubiquitin. Samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. The nickel–horseradish peroxidase (Nickel-HRP) was used to detect His tag ubiquitin. Note: E2/E3 specificities could be explored using different E2 proteins combined with the same E3 in this assay. E3/substrate ubiquitination assay The E3 and substrate protein should be fused with different tag (and the tag also should be different with the tag fused with E1, E2 and ubiquitin) and the recombinant proteins should be expressed and purified before use. The proteins also can be prepared via in vivo expression such as agroinfiltration in Nictotiana benthamiana. Prepare the reactions in total 30 μl, including 1.5 μl of 20x reaction buffer, 50 ng of E1, 200 ng of E2, 200-500 ng E3, 500 ng substrate proteins and 5 μg of ubiquitin. The reactions minus E1, minus E2 (and minus E3) respectively should be performed at the same time as control. Incubate the reactions at 30 °C for 1.5 h. Split the reactions by adding 10 μl 4x SDS sample buffer (with DTT or β- mercaptoethanol) and boil the samples at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction products are separated with 8–12% SDS-PAGE gel and detected with anti-ubiquitin antibody or antibody for certain tag fused with substrate protein by Western blotting. (see steps A5a-d) (Figure 3) Figure 3. HY5-GFP (substrate protein) was ubiquitinated by Myc-COP1 (E3 ligase) (Zhao et al., 2013). HY5-GFP and Myc-COP1 were all expressed via agroinfiltration. Then, the cell lysates were mixed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated product was applied for a further in vitro ubiquitination assay. E1 (from wheat), E2 (UBCH5b) and 6x His tagged Ubiquitin (Ub) were added to the reaction. ★represents the mixture of poly-ubiquitinated HY5-GFP and Myc-COP1. ▲means mono-ubiquitinated E2. (a) The in vitro ubiquitination samples were detected by immunoblot with anti-GFP antibody. (b) The in vitro ubiquitination samples were detected by immunoblot with Nickel-HRP (or anti-His antibody) to detect His-Ubiquitin. Note: The E3 proteins can be purified in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube from cell crude extract just before use as steps B1-5. And then the following E3-substrate ubiquitination reactions should be performed with agitation (900 rpm) in a thermomixer.."

        "@value": "In vivo Matrigel Plug Angiogenesis Assay. The matrigel plug angiogenesis assay is a simple in vivo technique to detect the newly formed blood vessels in the transplanted gel plugs in nude mice. The matrigel matrix is derived from the engelbroth-holm-swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, and its composition is comparable to the basement membrane proteins. The matrigel can induce differentiation of a variety of cell types such as hepatocytes, mammary epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. In our case, tumor cells are mixed with the matrigel gel and are injected into the mice. The later immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with the endothelial marker indicates the presence of the newly formed capillaries in the sectioned gel plugs.. Remove the medium from a T175 flask containing an 80-90% confluent monolayer of tumor cells (e.g. the nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE1 cells) and wash the cells with PBS. Detach the tumor cells by incubating with 3 ml trypsin for 5-10 min; stop trypsinization with 10 ml complete medium. Count the number of cells with a hemocytometer, spin down the cells at 1,200 rpm for 5 min and wash once with PBS. Mix a total of 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells (cell type-dependent) with 50 μl plain medium and 250 μl ice-cold matrigel (the matrigel maintains as liquid form at 2-8 °C and solidifies rapidly at 22 -37 °C). Subcutaneously inject the 300 μl cell matrigel mixture into a flank of five female athymic nude mice (one injection site per mouse) with an ice-cold syringe with a 24G one inch needle. Polymerize the matrigel mixed with the cells to form a solid gel plug, which allows cell growth and blood vessel formation. After inoculation for 7 days, excise the matrigel, fix with formalin overnight, embed in paraffin, and section onto slides. Stain the slides with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological observation. Stain the blood vessels formed with 150 μl endothelial cell marker CD34 monoclonal antibody (1:40) overnight at 4 °C and 150 μl secondary biotin-conjugated goat anti-Rat IgG antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Incubate the antibody with 150 μl streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:200) for 1 h at RT. Add the substrate DAB for signal detection. Scan the slides by the Aperio ScanScope System and quantify the signal by ImageScope v10 software. Figure 1. Representative results from matrigel plug assay. The endothelial cells were stained with anti-CD34 antibody, as indicated by the brown stain (indicated by arrows). A. Plenty of blood capillaries are formed in the gel plug section with growing tumor cells. B. Representative image of cell necrosis observed in center region of tumor nodules formed with lack of blood capillaries (indicated by asterisks).."

        "@value": "Transwell Cell Migration Assay Using Human Breast Epithelial Cancer Cell. Transwell migration assays have been widely used for studying the motility of different types of cells including metastatic cancer cells. The assay is also useful in screens for compounds that act as chemoattractants or inhibitors of chemotaxis for cells. The assay employs a permeable layer of support, usually a tissue-culture-treated microporous membrane, which is positioned between two compartments that mimic two different sets of microenvironments for cell survival/growth. Cells on one side of the membrane, when sensing chemoattractants placed on the other side of the compartment that diffuses through the membrane, can migrate through the pores in the membrane towards the source of the chemoattractants. Cells that migrate across the membrane can be quantified by fixing and counting. Human breast epithelial adenocarcinoma MD-231 cells grow relatively fast and are metastatic. The MB-231 cell line is used here to describe the procedures of an in vitro cell migration assay using the transwell apparatus.. Carry MB-231 cells in DMEM with 10% FBS (use L-15 medium if needed). Wash cells twice with 1x PBS and trypsinize. Add 0.5 mg/ml Trypsin inhibitor in PBS to inactivate an equal volume of Trypsin. Aspirate cells by pipetting up and down gently (Note: It is important to break down into individual cells as much as possible). Gently spin down the cells. Wash cells two times with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS to remove trace amounts of trypsin and inhitibor. Resuspend the cells in DMEM with 0.5% FBS and count. Prepare the transwell compartments, 24-well format, with 8 μm pore size insert: To the lower compartment, add 2.6 ml of DMEM with 0.5% FBS containing 40 μg ml-1 Collagen I. Add the transwell insert to the well by merging the bottom of the insert into the medium in the lower compartment. Note: Ensure that no air bubbles are trapped between the insert membrane and the medium. To the upper compartment, gently add 1 x 105 cells from step 4. Incubate the cells in the transwell plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2.5 h. This allows cells to migrate toward the underside of the insert filter. After 2.5 h, carefully take the insert out. Cells that do not migrate through the pores and therefore remain on the upper side of the filter membrane need to be gently removed with a cotton swab. Gently wipe the upper side of the filter membrane with a cotton swab to remove the cell debris. We recommend that use each clean cotton swab for one wipe only, in one direction and do not swipe in back-and-forth movement. The cotton swab can be slightly moisturized with ddH2O as needed but be sure to remove any excess water. Several wipes may be needed to completely remove any cell debris on the membrane. Fix the cells on the lower side of the insert filter quickly with 5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Next, stain cells on the lower side of the insert filter with 1% crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 20 min. Remove excess crystal violet by quickly merging the insert in ddH2O for 3 to 4 sec. Drain excess water from the side of the insert using a cotton swab. Dry the insert membrane. Count the number of cells on the lower side of the filter under a microscope. Randomly choose different views and take average counting. The same experimental procedure should be performed for control groups without chemoattractants. Each migration condition should be tested with replicates.."

        "@value": "Isolation and Quantification of Metabolite Levels in Murine Tumor Interstitial Fluid by LC/MS. Cancer is a disease characterized by altered metabolism, and there has been renewed interest in understanding the metabolism of tumors. Even though nutrient availability is a critical determinant of tumor metabolism, there has been little systematic study of the nutrients directly available to cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Previous work characterizing the metabolites present in the tumor interstitial fluid has been restricted to the measurement of a small number of nutrients such as glucose and lactate in a limited number of samples. Here we adapt a centrifugation-based method of tumor interstitial fluid isolation readily applicable to a number of sample types and a mass spectrometry-based method for the absolute quantitation of many metabolites in interstitial fluid samples. In this method, tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) is analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using both isotope dilution and external standard calibration to derive absolute concentrations of targeted metabolites present in interstitial fluid. The use of isotope dilution allows for accurate absolute quantitation of metabolites, as other methods of quantitation are inadequate for determining nutrient concentrations in biological fluids due to matrix effects that alter the apparent concentration of metabolites depending on the composition of the fluid in which they are contained. This method therefore can be applied to measure the absolute concentrations of many metabolites in interstitial fluid from diverse tumor types, as well as most other biological fluids, allowing for characterization of nutrient levels in the microenvironment of solid tumors.. Study design How many biological replicates are recommended? The number of biological replicates needed for studies will depend on the variability between samples. For animal studies, where a large number of variables can be controlled (i.e., tumor genetics, tumor size, animal genetics, animal diet, time of interstitial fluid isolation), variability will likely be smaller than for human samples. Additionally, the number of replicates required will depend on the intended purpose of the experiment to be performed. For example, if the intended purpose is to determine if there is a nutritional difference in the interstitial fluid between two tumor types, it is important to determine an effect size between the groups in addition to variability between samples in order to estimate sample sizes needed. We recommend generating pilot data or utilizing previously published data on TIF composition differences (Sullivan et al., 2019) to estimate effect sizes and utilizing power analysis software in Metaboanalyst (Chong et al., 2018) or other statistical analysis software to estimate the number of biological replicates needed. Additionally, when determining the number of biological replicates needed, it is important to note that not every tumor will necessarily yield interstitial fluid. In our experience, roughly 75% of murine pancreatic adenocarcinomas yielded tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) with volumes ranging from 5 to 180 μl of fluid (Sullivan et al., 2019). Therefore, additional samples may be required to achieve the required number of replicates determined from power analysis. We recommend harvesting TIF at the same time from all animals involved in a study. Circadian rhythm and food intake can alter plasma metabolite levels and therefore TIF metabolite levels, introducing additional variability (Dallmann et al., 2012; Abbondante et al., 2016). If TIF must be harvested from animals on different days, we recommend harvesting TIF at the same time during the day. We recommend two people work together to isolate TIF and cardiac blood to increase the speed of TIF harvest to prevent alterations in TIF composition due to prolonged periods of ischemia occurring between euthanasia and TIF harvest. In our own experiments, dissection was completed in ~2 min. and we found limited evidence of ischemia altering tumor metabolite levels (Sullivan et al., 2019). We have successfully isolated TIF using the protocol described in Procedure B from multiple genetically engineered and implantation mouse models of breast, lung, prostate, pancreas and melanoma cancers and others have isolated TIF from murine models of melanoma and breast cancer (Ho et al., 2015; Eil et al., 2016; Spinelli et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) using similar protocols. Additionally, similar protocols have been used to isolate TIF from renal (Siska et al., 2017) and ovarian carcinomas (Haslene-Hox et al., 2011). Thus, we anticipate the TIF isolation protocol can be used successfully for a variety of tumor types, of mouse and human origin. The analysis described in Procedure C uses 7 separate chemical standard pools as described in (Sullivan et al., 2019) that enable the quantification of 149 metabolites commonly measured in biofluids (Lawton et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2009; Mazzone et al., 2016; Cantor et al., 2017). However, depending on experimental goals, the full analysis utilizing all 7 standard pools may not be required. Subsets of the chemical standard pools can be used that cover analytes of interest if the full analysis is not needed. Note though that individual metabolites in the standard pools provided in this protocol have been carefully selected so as to avoid metabolites with the same m/z (isomeric and isobaric species) being in the same pool. In addition, metabolites that could be generated by in-source fragmentation from larger metabolites have been separated. The description of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in this protocol (Procedure D) is a rough guideline for experienced operators of such instruments to perform the analysis described. Successful mass spectrometry analysis of the samples will require a trained UHPLC and Thermo Scientific hybrid quadrupole-Oribtrap mass spectrometer operator. Isolation of TIF and plasma from tumor bearing animals Prepare a TIF isolation tube (Figure 1 A). Take a nylon filter and place it over the top of a 50 ml conical tube. Tape the filter down using lab tape. Make sure the filter is affixed somewhat loosely to the top of the conical tube, such that the tumor can push the filter down slightly into the tube. Figure 1. Collecting TIF using nylon mesh filters attached to conical tubes. A. The filter is loosely affixed to the top of the conical tube using laboratory tape, so that the filter will sag slightly into the conical tube when a sample is placed on top of the filter. B. A sample on top of the filter and conical tube. C. After adding the sample to the filter, the lid of the conical tube is placed on top, but not screwed onto the conical. Instead, it is taped using laboratory tape in place. D. ~30 μl of tumor interstitial fluid (colored blue to here for contrast) collected in the conical tube after centrifugation. Prepare materials in advance to allow for rapid mouse dissection. Put pre-chilled (4 °C) saline (~25 ml) into a Petri dish for washing the tumor. Make a ~4 cm square piece of Whatman paper for drying the tumors after the saline rinse. Have a 25G TB syringe ready for cardiac blood collection. Label and pre-chill one EDTA-coated plasma collection tubes on ice for 10 min prior to mouse dissection. Euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation. Spray around the incision site with 70% ethanol to prevent contamination of samples with hair. Quickly and cleanly dissect the tumor away from the animal. The exact procedure for the dissection will depend on the anatomical location of the tumor. One person should continue with the following steps while the other person can start on plasma isolation (Step B6). Place the tumor into the saline containing Petri dish to rinse the tumor. Blot the tumor dry on Whatman paper. Take care at this step to ensure all saline is blotted from the tumor, so that saline does not contaminate the TIF. If concerned about saline contamination during TIF isolation, we suggest the following additional step: add a non-natural metabolite such as norvaline to the saline. Continue with the remainder of the protocol as normal. Subsequently, when analyzing TIF samples, determine if the non-natural metabolite is present in the TIF sample. If the non-natural metabolite is detected this indicates saline contamination, whereas if the metabolite is not detected saline contamination is unlikely. Optional: Weigh the tumor if this information is needed. Tumor volume can also be determined by caliper measurements if needed. Place the tumor on top of the nylon mesh filter that is affixed to the conical tube (Figure 1B). Place the 50 ml conical lid over the tumor and tape the lid in place (Figure 1C). Centrifuge the tumor at 4 °C for 10 min at 106 x g using a refrigerated clinical centrifuge (e.g., Sorvall Legend X1R). Remove the 50 ml conical tube. If the isolation worked, there will be 10-50 μl of fluid in the bottom of the conical tube (Figure 1D). Keep the tube on ice. Note: Human tumors have been found to yield 5-150 μl of fluid per gram of tumor (Haslene-Hox et al., 2011). Similarly, we isolated 10-50 μl of fluid from murine pancreatic tumors weighing ~0.3-2.5 g (Sullivan et al., 2019). There is not an exact correlation between tumor size and TIF volume, as many factors likely influence interstitial volume. However, larger tumors are more likely to yield TIF in larger volumes. Tumors with large fluid filled cysts can give hundreds of μl of fluid per gram of tumor. Disregard these from analysis as it is unclear if the cystic fluid is representative of interstitial fluid. Remove the isolate fluid to a fresh Eppendorf tube. The fluid can be extracted directly for LC/MS analysis or frozen and stored at -80 °C for future analysis. We have analyzed TIF samples both before and after 2 months of storage at -80 °C (avoiding freeze-thaw cycles) and detected similar metabolite concentrations after storage (Sullivan et al., 2019). Thus, TIF samples can be stored for at least 2 months without freeze-thaw cycles prior to analysis. The tumor from which TIF was isolated can be used for additional analysis using other appropriate protocols. Note: We have successfully used tumors from which TIF was isolated for immunohistochemical, immunoblotting and flow cytometric analyses. Use the 25G TB syringe to isolate blood from the mouse heart by cardiac puncture. Cardiac puncture can be a difficult technique to perform. Detailed protocols with video documentation of cardiac puncture blood isolation have been previously published (Schroeder, 2019). If unfamiliar with this technique, we recommend utilizing these resources for more detailed information on isolating blood in this manner. Dissect open the thoracic cavity. Insert the syringe into the ventricle. Slowly withdraw blood to prevent collapse of the heart. Remove the needle from the syringe to prevent cell lysis when expelling the cells from the syringe. Expel the blood into the EDTA-coated plasma collection tube. Keep plasma on ice. Spin the EDTA-coated plasma collection tubes at 845 x g in benchtop centrifuge (e.g., Sorvall Legend Micro 21) for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the plasma from the pelleted blood cells and put into fresh Eppendorf tube. Extract this plasma directly for LC/MS analysis or freeze and store at -80 °C for future analysis. Note: Previous studies have found that plasma samples can be stored at -80 °C (without freeze-thaw cycles) for up to 30 months without significant alterations in the levels of many metabolites (Stevens et al., 2019). Thus, plasma samples can be stored for many months prior to analysis. Extraction of metabolites from TIF and plasma Prepare libraries of pooled chemical standards that include the metabolites to be quantified. See Recipes section and Tables 5-11 for details on how libraries were compounded in (Sullivan et al., 2019). Prepare metabolite extraction buffer (EB) (Recipe 5) with appropriate isotopically labeled internal standards. See Recipes section for details on making EB with isotopic standards as described in (Sullivan et al., 2019). Note: Make enough EB for the number of samples and standards you have plus an additional 10%, so as not to run out of EB before extracting metabolites from every sample. 45 μl of EB is needed for each sample and standard pool dilution. Isotopically labeled metabolite standards in the EB are not indefinitely stable. Prepare EB fresh prior to each experiment. Prepare dilutions of chemical standard libraries in HPLC grade water. The highest concentration should be 5 mM. Next, make dilution series of each standard pool in HPLC grade water as listed below in Step C5. Keep these on ice prior to extraction. Note that multiple dilutions of the chemical standard libraries are required for construction of standard curves relating known metabolite concentration to LC/MS response, which is necessary for downstream analysis of metabolite concentrations. Below we recommend a scheme to generate 8-point standard curves covering physiological concentrations of metabolites, but variations are possible. The 5 mM pool will not be always in solution for each pool, therefore vortex vigorously and immediately pipette from this mixture in order to prevent error from settling particles: Take 20 μl of 5 mM stock and dilute into 80 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 1 mM solution. Take 30 μl of 1 mM stock and dilute into 70 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 300 μM solution. Take 33.33 μl of 300 μM stock and dilute into 66.67 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 100 μM solution. Take 30 μl of 100 µM stock and dilute into 70 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 30 μM solution. Take 33.33 μl of 30 μM stock and dilute into 66.67 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 10 μM solution. Take 30 μl of 10 μM stock and dilute into 70 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 3 µM solution. Take 33.33 μl of 3 μM stock and dilute into 66.67 μl HPLC grade water to yield a 1 μM solution. Thaw the TIF and plasma samples on ice. Add 5 μl of each TIF sample, plasma sample and chemical standard library dilution (Recipe 6) to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Keep on ice. Add 45 μl of EB to each sample/standard. Keep on ice. Vortex all the samples for 10 min at maximum speed at 4 °C. Spin down all samples for 10 min at 21,000 x g at 4 °C. Take 20 μl of the mixtures from the Eppendorf tube and add to an LC/MS sample vial. Cap the vial. Note: A minimum of 15 μl is needed in the LC/MS vial to ensure correct and accurate injection by the autosampler. The vials described in Materials and Reagents contain fused inserts. Vials without inserts will require larger volumes. Freeze the remaining sample in the Eppendorf tubes and store at -80 °C. This sample can be run later if the initial LC/MS is not successful. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of extracted metabolites Start off with a clean system (use appropriate LC cleaning methods in place in your lab). Calculate the amount of Mobile Phase A (Recipe 1) required and prepare fresh on the day of analysis. Store this for no more than one week. Note: Depending on your system, you will use ~2 ml per injection and require an additional 50-100 ml in the bottle. Do not forget to make enough Mobile Phase A for additional injection types such as solvent blanks and system suitability tests that must be run in addition to the samples. Calculate the amount of Mobile Phase B (Recipe 2) required and prepare more if needed. Depending on your system, you will need ~2 ml per injection plus an additional 50-100 ml in the bottle. Check the level of rear seal wash (Recipe 3) and top up if needed. If using an UHPLC system that has a separate needle wash, fill this with acetonitrile. Connect a SeQuant® ZIC®-pHILIC 5 μm 150 x 2.1 mm analytical column to the Guard column using the connector supplied in the Guard kit. Connect the column and guard to your UHPLC system using standard techniques. Set the column oven temperature to 25 °C. Set the autosampler temperature to 4 °C. Set initial conditions: set the flow rate to 0.150 ml/min with 80% B. Record initial pressure value. Note: ZIC-pHILIC columns cannot tolerate such high back pressures and injection volumes as typical reverse phase columns. Keep an eye on the back pressure and do not let it exceed the maximum pressure recommended by the manufacturer. It is good practice to set a maximum pressure in your method that is below that set by the manufacturer to avoid damage to the column. Equilibrate the column with starting conditions (80% B) for 30 min prior to running anything on the system. Check the mass calibration on the mass spectrometer. If the mass has not been calibrated within the last week, or if it fails the mass check, recalibrate using the standard calibration mixes recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, perform a custom low-mass calibration by spiking glycine and aspartate into the calibration mix, or as recommended by the manufacturer. Ensure your entire LCMS system performance is acceptable by running system suitability tests, such as injecting a mixture of amino acids onto your column and into the MS. Check for signal intensity as well as peak shape and separation. Use the conditions shown in Table 1 below for the UHPLC gradient: Table 1. LC parameters Time (min) Flow rate (ml/min) %B 0.00 0.150 80 20.0 0.150 20 20.5 0.150 80 28.0 0.150 80 Operate the mass spectrometer in full-scan, polarity-switching mode, with a scan range of 70-1000 m/z. Include an additional narrow-range scan from 220 to 700 m/z in negative mode to improve detection of nucleotides. Use the parameters shown below in Tables 2 and 3 for the MS: Table 2. MS source parameters Parameter Setting Spray voltage 3.0 kV (pos); 3.1 kV (neg) Heated capillary 275 °C HESI probe 350 °C Sheath gas 40 units Aux gas 15 units Sweep gas 1 unit Table 3. MS scan parameters Parameter Setting Resolution 70,000 AGC target 1E6 Max IT 20 ms Note that in this particular study, we had previously collected MS/MS data for each metabolite being quantified, and used this to confirm retention times using a library of chemical standards. If adding new metabolites to your standard pools, collect MS/MS data on the standard itself, as well as on a pooled biological sample to help confirm peak identification. Write your sequence (sample run order) using Thermo Scientific Xcalibur Sequence Setup View. Note: Given the extremely low volume of samples used in this method, the sequence differs from typical sequences which will include column conditioning injections, as well as quality control pooled samples. As multiple standard curves are run and each sample includes 13C-labeled internal standards, we chose to forgo using precious sample to create QC pools and instead determine linearity and consistency of metabolite detection using the standard curves and the 13C internal standards. Start off by injecting several water blanks to ensure system is clean from carry over and contaminants. Include solvent blanks, using the 75/25/0.1 acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid mix that was used to make the extraction mix. Follow with a system suitability test (SST) injection. We use 80% methanol containing 13C-15N labeled amino acid mix (Recipe 4). Add the samples to your sequence and follow with the standard curves, starting with the lowest concentration and working up to the highest concentration for each curve. Separate each curve with solvent blank and check for carry-over. Insert additional SST injections every 8-10 samples. These will be used as QCs to ensure no loss of signal over time. Set the injection volume to 2 μl for each injection type. Set the instrument method to the appropriate method. Save the sequence file. Randomize sample running order to decrease the chance of signal loss over time. Export the sequence as a .csv file. Open in Microsoft Excel, cut and paste the samples into a new tab, leaving behind the blanks, STTs and standard curves. Add an additional column and use the = rand () function to create random numbers for each of the samples. Now sort the samples from smallest to largest using the random number values. Cut and paste back into the previous sequence containing the blanks, SSTs and the standard curves. Save the .csv file with “random” in the file name. Import the new randomized sequence back into Xcalibur Sequence View and save using “random” in the file name. Place your sample vials in the autosampler in the vial positions according to the sequence. Use the non-randomized sequence to check vial positions for your samples. Ensure the solvent blank vials and SST vials contain enough volume for multiple injections. Run the sequence. Note: For examples of expected outputs from the LC/MS analysis of TIF and plasma samples, LC/MS data from (Sullivan et al., 2019) is available at https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Project&ProjectID=PR000750.. Cell division requires the duplication of the biomass of the mother cell prior to division. As a result, growing cells must be able to utilize the nutrients available in their environments to synthesize the macromolecules required to divide. To sustain cancerous proliferation, tumors often exhibit altered metabolism (DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016). In many cases, tumor metabolism is driven by cell-intrinsic processes such as oncogenic activation (Cairns et al., 2011; Nagarajan et al., 2016). However, recent work has highlighted the importance of cell-extrinsic factors in dictating cancer cell metabolism (Anastasiou, 2017; Bi et al., 2018; Muir et al., 2018). The importance of the extracellular environment in shaping cancer metabolism is perhaps unsurprising, as the nutrient environment in which a cancer cell exists constrains which metabolic reactions are possible within that cell. Since cell-extrinsic metabolite levels can play a role in determining the behavior of tumor cells, it is critical to examine tumor cell metabolism under physiological conditions. However, our understanding of the metabolic composition of the tumor microenvironment is lacking.The nutrient environment that a cancer cell has access to is predominantly composed of interstitial fluid (Wiig and Swartz, 2012). Understanding the nutrient content of tumor interstitial fluid would provide insight into the metabolic constraints imposed upon tumor cells by their environment. There exist multiple methodologies for isolating interstitial fluid from normal organs and from tumors (Wiig et al., 2010). However, early attempts to measure the nutrient content of interstitial fluid were limited by their inability to measure multiple metabolites, and consequently our knowledge of nutrient availability in tumors is restricted to a few metabolites in a limited number of animal tumor models (Burgess and Sylven, 1962; Gullino et al., 1964). The advent of mass spectrometry has allowed for detection of many metabolites simultaneously. However, despite technological advances, metabolomics studies are complicated by the fact that components present in biological fluids can suppress or enhance the detection of specific metabolites. These discrepancies in detection of metabolites between different biological fluids are termed “matrix effects,” and are a major confounding factor in comparing metabolite concentrations between different biological fluids and in accurately quantitating metabolites in those fluids (Panuwet et al., 2016; Sullivan et al., 2019).Here we demonstrate a method for centrifugation-based isolation of tumor interstitial fluid and the subsequent absolute quantitation of numerous metabolites within that fluid using stable isotope dilution, a technique in which stable isotope-labeled internal standards for metabolites of interest are added to experimental samples. These stable isotope internal standards are subject to the same matrix effects as the corresponding metabolite in the sample and can be distinguished by their increased mass compared to the metabolites in the sample. To measure many metabolites simultaneously, we first quantitate the concentrations of 13C metabolites from an extract of polar metabolites from yeast that are cultured with 13C isotopically labeled glucose as the sole carbon source. This quantitated yeast extract is then used as an internal standard that allows for reliable quantification of targeted metabolites in biological samples while minimizing systematic error from matrix effects. This approach provides a robust method to quantitate polar metabolites in biological fluids and complements similar existing isotope dilution based methods, such as the commercially available Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ kits (Gieger et al., 2008) that primarily quantify non-polar lipids in biological samples.The absolute quantitation of metabolite levels enabled by this protocol can allow for direct comparison of interstitial fluid composition in diverse tumor types, providing the opportunity to systematically interrogate nutrient availability in animal models of diverse cancers and human tumor samples. Further, the absolute quantification of metabolite levels in interstitial fluid allows for the generation of tissue culture media that mimics physiological conditions found in a tumor, thus expanding the range of in vitro/ ex vivo experiments that can be carried out under physiological nutrient conditions. Most broadly, this protocol provides a method to absolutely quantify many metabolites simultaneously in complex biological fluids, which can be used to study the metabolic composition of any biological material."

        "@value": "Organotypic Slice Culture of Embryonic Brain Sections. This technique will allow using brain slices to study several aspects of cortical development (i.e. neurogenesis), as well as neuronal differentiation (i.e. neuronal migration, axon and dendrite formation) in situ. This protocol is suitable for various embryonic stages (Calderon de Anda et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2010).. Remove the head of electroporated mouse embryos (see “In utero Electroporation of Mouse Embryo Brains” (Ge, 2011) and place it into ice-cold 1x PBS. Dissect out the whole brain and place it into ice-cold PBS. Do not let the brain more that 30 min in ice-cold PBS. Faster the brain is processed; better brain slices quality will be obtained. Fill a 30 mm petri dish with 3% low-melting agarose prepared in 1x PBS (use enough agarose to cover the brain) pre-warmed at 40 °C in a microwave. Monitor the temperature with a thermometer while steering the agarose solution with it. The brain will be put into the agarose when the temperature drops to about 35 °C-37 °C, try to use fresh 3% low-melting agarose every time you prepare brain slices. Take out the brain from the ice-cold PBS with a curved spatula and carefully remove the PBS solution from the tissue with a Kimwipe. Use the Kimwipe as a wick. Critical step to maintain the structure of the brain in culture: Try to remove as much PBS solution as possible from the tissue. Avoid the Kimwipe to adhere to the brain in order to prevent tissue damage. Place the Kimwipe as close as you can to the brain to absorb, as much PBS solution as possible. A “PBS solution-free” brain is better embedded into the agarose solution. Thus, once the brain is sliced the brain sections do not detach from the agarose. Place the brain into 3% low-melting agarose (35 °C-37 °C) in a petri dish (olfactory bulb facing down, Figure 1A). Put the petri dish on ice and wait until the agarose solidifies. Carefully keep the position of the brain with the spatula meanwhile the agarose solidifies. Cut the agarose around the brain and keep the brain in the middle of the agarose block. Try to cut the block with a pyramidal shape in such a way that the base of the brain (cerebellum) is the base of the pyramid and the olfactory bulb faces the apex of the pyramid (Figure 1B). This agarose block configuration will allow a steady position of the block when glued at the vibratome tray’s holder (the base of the agarose pyramid faces the vibratome holder). Glue the agarose block containing the brain onto the vibratome tray with Krazyglue or similar glue. Add ice-cold 1x PBS into the vibratome tray to cover the agarose block. Slices the agarose block. Slice thickness: 240 μm (tissue flatten over time with thinner slices). Vibratome settings: speed 4-5; vibration 6. Collect slices with curved spatula carefully to avoid the tissue to detach from the agarose. Transfer the slices into a Millicell culture insert system containing 1 ml medium (Figure C; Neurobasal supplemented with B27, N2, 0.5 mM Glutamine, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, and 5% horse serum). Put as many slices as you can put on top of the membrane insert (generally 4-5 slices per insert). Remove carefully the solution that surrounds the slice with pipette tip. Tissue must be exposed to air. Place the culture insert dish with slices into tissue culture incubator (37 °C) for 1-2 h The slices are ready to use (i.e. Time-lapse imaging). This culture system has been used for 48 h time-lapse imaging (de Anda F., et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2010). Also is possible to use this culture system for pharmacological treatments (de Anda F., et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2010). Figure 1. (A) Brain is embedded, with the olfactory bulb facing down, in a preti dish with 3% low-melting agarose. (B) Once the agarose solidifies cut the agarose around the brain with a pyramidal shape in such a way that the base of the brains (side of the cerebellum) is at the base of the pyramid and olfactory bulb faces the apex of the pyramid. (C) Transfer coronal sections from the brain on top of the Millicell culture insert system containing 1 ml medium.."

By conjugating cells with specific antibodies and subsequently magnetic beads isolation, using the technique from Miltenyi, this allows a high purity.. Sacrifice mouse and isolate the complete spleen. Pass spleen through a 100-μm cell strainer to get single cells suspension by crushing with forceps and collecting the cell suspension in 5 ml PBS. Wash with 1x PBS & centrifuge the cells (100 x g for 5 min), then resuspend spleen cells in 80 μl ice-cold separation buffer per 107 cells. From a normal spleen you will get approximately 8 x 107 cells. The overall operation temperature is room temperature. The buffers should be ice cold. Add a 20 μl aliquot of antibody-conjugated microbeads per 107 cells incubate for 30 min at 4-8 °C at a shaker. No prewash is needed. The number of cells is depending from the animal. The following microbeads were used: anti-CD43 microbeads for negative isolation of resting B cells, anti-CD90 microbeads for positive isolation of total T cells, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 microbeads for positive isolation of the respective T-cell subset. Wash the column by putting 5 ml 1x PBS on the top. The liquid passes the column by gravity. Then pipette the labelled cell suspension on top of a separation column, which had been washed three times with separation buffer and placed in the MiniMACS separation unit. Pass the suspension through the column. In case of negative selection of CD43- B cells the effluent was collected as a B-cell fraction and washed respectively centrifuged three times with 5 ml PBS. In case of positive selection of CD90+, CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells the effluent was discarded and the columns were washed twice with 500 μl separation buffer. Subsequently, remove columns from the separator and wash magnetically labelled cells out with 1 ml separation buffer using a plunger. Wash the respective T-cell fraction three times with medium same as B-cells Assess the purity of the various cell fractions by Flow cytometry analysis using a Flow cytometer. Stain cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11 to detect total T-cells), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD19 (clone 1D3 to detect B-cells), FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5 to detect CD4+ T-cells) and PE-conjugated anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7 to detect CD8+ T-cells) and analyse for positive cells according to standard procedures.."

        "@value": "Analysis of Protein Stability by the Cycloheximide Chase Assay. Comparison of protein stability in eukaryotic cells has been achieved by cycloheximide, which is an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis due to its prevention in translational elongation. It is broadly used in cell biology in terms of determining the half-life of a given protein and has gained much popularity in cancer research. Here we present a full cycloheximide chase assay in our laboratory using a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, CL1-5, as a model.. Seed about 6 x 105 cells in 35-mm dishes and have them incubated in a CO2 incubator overnight. After 12-h incubation, remove the medium and add complete medium with 300 μg/ml* cycloheximide (dissolved in DMSO) into each dish. *The concentration of cycloheximide depends on the cell line used. For CL1-5 cells, 300 μg/ml cyclcoheximide does not cause apoptosis within the time course of the chase assay. It is recommended to start a cell line test with different concentrations of cycloheximide (ranging from 50-300 μg/ml) for a least 8-h chase. For transfected cells, to avoid the sub-efficient cycloheximide concentrations, the expression of tagged proteins should be determined in the absence or presence of different concentrations of cycloheximide by Western blot at 24 h after transfection. Prepare the protein lysis buffer with freshly-added protease inhibitor. About 200 μl of lysis buffer is needed for one 35-mm dish. Lyse t = 0 h cells with the protein lysis buffer and store the lysates in a -80 °C freezer. Collect lysates at other time points (t = 1, 2, 3, 6 h) according to the experimental design. After all the lysates have been collected, sonicate the protein lysates with a sonicator for 10 times (1 sec/time) on ice. Centrifuge lysates at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Collect and transfer the supernatants to new tubes with corresponding labels. Determine protein concentrations by the BCA protein assay kit. Take 50 μg of proteins, add 5x sample buffer, and incubate samples at 100 °C for 10 min. Analyze the results by the SDS-PAGE assay and Western blotting (anti-Flag M2 antibodies with 1:5,000 dilution; β-actin antibodies with 1:10,000 dilution). Quantify the Western bands of Flag and β-actin in triplicates using MetaMorph Software or other equivalent softwares.."

Regulation of gene expression involves dynamic changes in chromatin organization, where in many cases open chromatin structure correlates with gene activation. Several methods enable monitoring changes in chromatin accessibility, including ATAC-seq, FAIRE-seq, MNase-seq and DNAse-seq methods, which involve Next-generation-sequencing (NGS). Focusing on the adult Drosophila differentiated gut enterocytes (ECs) we used a sequencing-free method that enables visualizing and semi-quantifying large-scale changes in chromatin structure using in vitro methylation assay with the bacterial CpG Methyltransferase, M. Sssl, that determine chromatin accessibility. In brief, as CpG methylation is minimal in differentiated somatic Drosophila cells, we used the bacterial M. SssI enzyme to methylate CpG dinucleotides in situ depending on their chromatin accessibility. The methylated dinucleotides are detected using 5mCytosine monoclonal antibody and nuclei are visualized microscopically. Thus, the 5mC method enables to monitor large-scale chromatin changes in heterogenic cellular tissue focusing on the cell type of interest and without the need for cell purification or NGS.. Flies collection Drosophila flies are reared at 22 °C on standard medium. To prevent gender differences, collect only female flies at relevant age. For collecting young adults, we used 3-10 days old flies that were transferred to 29 °C for two days for activating the GAL4/Gal80 system and UAS-RNAi for gene knockdown. For more details regarding the GAL4/GAL80 system, see Salmeron et al. (1990) and Brand and Perrimon (1993). 5mC methylation assay Dissect guts in watch glasses squares filled with cold Schneider medium. Transfer dissected guts to an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml Schneider medium. Eppendorf tubes with dissected guts are kept on ice. Collect 8-10 guts per Eppendorf tube. For detailed gut dissection, see an excellent midgut protocol (Nawrot-Esposito et al., 2017). Remove Schneider media and add 1 ml cold DPBS to wash dissected guts (replace media only without incubation time). Fix: Replace DPBS with 1 ml of freshly made \"Fix-I solution\" (Recipe 1), this will form two phases of liquids: the upper phase is Heptane and lower phase is the formaldehyde/DPBS solution at the bottom (See Figure 3 “Fix”). Rotate for 20 min on an orbital shaker at RT. Note: Over-crosslinking can cause reduced diffusion and accessibility of the enzyme to the nuclei. Figure 3. Typical Eppendorf tube after formation of the two phases Gently remove all the liquid solutions (the 2 phases) leaving only the dissected tissue at the bottom. Be sure to remove all heptane, also from the cap. Wash guts three times with 1 ml DPBS, in each wash rotate the guts for 15 min at RT. Permeabilization: Permeabilize the tissue by incubating with 500 µl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 1h on an orbital shaker in Eppendorf tubes, at RT (we recommend evaluating different permeabilization conditions [e.g., 1 h, 2 h and triton concentrations (0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%)]). Gently remove Triton solution, and wash for three times with DPBS, in each wash rotate the guts for 15 min at RT. Block in 1 ml \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2) overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. Wash twice with freshly prepared 250 μl of \"Pre-reaction Buffer \"(Recipe 3), 15 min each wash. Methylation reaction: Gently remove \"Pre-Reaction Buffer” and resuspend in 50 µl of M. SssI reaction buffer (Recipe 4) and incubate for 1 h at 25 °C, on an orbital shaker. Important: Titer the reaction conditions time (e.g., 1 h, 5 h, 24 h) and enzyme amount (25 U, 50 U) for optimal results. Termination: Add 1 ml of 2 N HCl and rotate on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 30 min. This step stops the M. SssI reaction and denatures the DNA. Remove HCl solution and neutralize with 0.5 ml of freshly prepared 100 mM Borax (dissolved in water) and rotate on an orbital shaker for 5 min at RT. Remove Borax and wash twice with 1 ml DPBS, rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash. Fix with freshly prepared \"Fix-II solution\" (Recipe 5) and rotate for 10 min. Remove Fix-II and wash twice with 1 ml \"PBX solution\" (Recipe 6), rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash. Note: Evaluate different time points (10, 15, 20 min) as over-crosslinking could affect antibody penetration. Remove PBX and block with 1 ml \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), for 30 min rotating at RT. Remove blocking solution and add diluted anti-5mC primary antibody in \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), to a concentration of 1 μg/ml (1:1,000). Incubate overnight at 4 °C on an Orbital shaker. Remove primary antibody and wash three times with \"PBT solution\" (Recipe 7), rotating for 15 min each wash at RT. Remove PBT and incubate in diluted Secondary Fluorescent anti-mouse (1:1,000) together with DAPI (1:1,000) (for DNA staining) in \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), cover the samples with aluminum foil or in a light protected box, and rotate on orbital shaker for 1 h in the dark. Remove Secondary antibody and DAPI solution and wash three times with \"PBT solution\" (recipe 7), 15 min each wash while rotating in light protected environment (box or aluminum foil) at RT. Wash twice with 1 ml DPBS, rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash. Mount in a Fluoromount-G (25 ml) on slide and keep at 4 °C until confocal microscopic analysis. Visualize under a confocal microscope, signal intensity in cells can be quantified. For quantification we suggest counting several hundreds of cells derived from different biological repeats, and in each scoring 5mC positive polyploid cells.. The regulation of the differentiated state of cells requires active supervision and is established and maintained by “identity supervisors” (Natoli, 2010; Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012). In part, these supervisors are transcription factors (TFs) that together with chromatin and architectural/scaffold proteins establish and maintain large-scale organization of the differentiated nucleus (Bitman-Lotan and Orian, 2018). In both mammals and Drosophila, the adult gut is a highly dynamic tissue where intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferate to self-renew or differentiate to give rise to mature differentiated gut polyploid enterocytes (ECs) (Jiang and Edgar, 2012; Buchon et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2016). In the differentiated ECs, the transcription factor Hey together with the Drosophila type A lamin, Lamin-C, co-regulate enhancers activity and large-scale nuclear organization that prevents the expression of progenitor and non-relevant programs (Flint-Brodsly et al., 2019). Genetic ablation of Hey in young ECs, or due to its decline during aging lead to a failure to express EC programs, including a decrease in LamC protein. Loss of LamC resulted in the ectopic expression of non-relevant gene programs and re-organization of the nucleus. These large-scale changes in chromatin organization can be visualized using the 5mC method as shown in Figures 1A and 1B. Moreover, the 5mC method was also used to monitor changes in chromatin accessibility in other Drosophila tissues such as the ovary upon loss of upSETR, a chromatin regulator (Rincon-Arano et al., 2012). Please note that while the method provides a qualitative approach to address chromatin organization in complex tissues, NGS-based approaches should be considered to confirm and fine map structural changes.Figure 1. Loss of Hey in ECs results in increased chromatin accessibility in polyploid cells.Confocal images of midguts expressing the indicated transgenes: A. Control midgut stained for 5mC without M.

We acquired the TopFlash (TCL/LEF-Firefly luciferase) construct from Addgene.. Grow low passage NIH3T3 or HEK293 cells from liquid nitrogen stock Briefly thaw cells at 37 °C water bath. Pipette cells into 15 ml thermal scientific Nunc conical tubes and spin for 5 min at 1,500 x g. Aspirate media, re-suspend cells in 15 ml growth media and plate in T75 culture flask (Cells are plated at the density at 1 x 106 and are cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2.). Split the cells when they grow to 60% sub-confluency. The cell line should be subculturing for one or two time before performing the actual assay, and then plate the cells into 24-well plates as triplicate according to the experimental conditions (5 x 104 cells/well). Transfection Day 0: Seed cells (density as above-mentioned) in a total volume of 500 μl complete growth media (DMEM/10% FBS). Day 1: Transfection (use ratio of 7XTCL/LEF-firefly luciferase: pRL-SV40-Renilla luciferase as 10: 1; use 1.5 μl TransIT-2020/300 ng of DNA/well). Day 2: Change media 24 h after transfection (optimal). Day 3: Change to serum-deprived media. Day 5: Lyse cells (1x whole cell lysis buffer available from the Dual-Luciferase @ Reporter Assay System) and collect aliquot of supernatant (20 μl) from cell lysis, plate them into 96-well plate. Reading luminescence signal Thaw dual-luciferase reporter reagents. Flash and prime Berthold luminometer with firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase substrate reagents. Firefly luciferase substrate is a derivative of D-luciferin. In response to D-luciferin enzymatic activity (firefly luciferase), a firefly luciferase chemical reaction will generate oxyluciferin and a specific light signal at 560 nm that can be detected by the luminometer. Renilla luciferase substrate is a derivative of Coelenterazine. In response to renilla enzymatic activity (renilla luciferase), a renilla luciferase chemical reaction will generate coelenteramide and a specific light signal at 480 nm that can be detected by the luminometer. 20 μl of each substrate is added sequencially by the luminometer and light signals generated are instantly measured by the luminometer (Light signals are detected at an enclosed chamber of the luminometer at ambient temperature). Read firefly and renilla luciferase signals (firefly luciferase signal is detected at 560 nm and renilla luciferase signal is detected at 480 nm).."

        "@value": "Ribosome Fractionation in Yeast. This protocol describes yeast ribosome fractionation in the gradient of sucrose. During the cyclic process of translation, a small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunit associate with mRNA to form an 80S complex (monosome). This ribosome moves along the mRNA during translational elongation, and then dissociates into the 40S and 60S subunits on termination. During elongation by one ribosome, further ribosomes can initiate translation on the same mRNA to form polysomes. The mass of each polysomal complex is determined primarily by the number of ribosomes it contains. Hence, the population of polysomes within the cell can be size-fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation on the basis of the loading of ribosomes on the mRNA. Several compounds help to maintain or to disrupt the polysomes (Figure 1).. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8. To keep the polysomes add cycloheximide (CHX) till final concentration 0.1 mg/ml and incubate 10 min on ice. Spin the cells for 5 min at 4,000 x g and wash with 50 ml of cold water containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX. Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX, spin. Cells can be frozen and stored at -20 °C. Work on ice! Resuspend the pellet in 0.4 ml of buffer A, add 0.5 ml of glass beads and disrupt 15 min on the glass bead beater at 4 °C. To avoid the contamination with cells derby preclean the total extracts. For this transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Centrifuge 1 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into the new eppendorf tube and centrifuge 10 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Measure the total protein concentrations in the supernatants [= TE (Total Extracts)]. For this dilute the total extracts 1:20 and load 5 and 10 μl to the Bradford sample (0.8 ml of water and 0.2 ml of Bradford reactive). Note: Lysate should be fresh, they can not be frozen! Pour 12 ml gradients (7 to 47% sucrose) using Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO) (Figure 2). Gradients are best poured at the night before the centrifugation. Keep the gradients at 4 °C before loading samples. Balance gradient volumes in paired rotor buckets firstly by eye, carefully removing some of top of gradient using a pipette tip if necessary. Check with the balance. Figure 2. Preparation of sucrose density gradients for polysome analysis. 6 ml of 7% (marked in blue) and 6 ml of 47% (marked in pink) sucrose solutions are placed into the front and back compartments of a gradient pourer, respectively. A small magnetic flea is used to mix the solution in the front compartment, which is drained slowly using a peristaltic pump to the bottom of the centrifuge tube (approx 10 min per gradient). Care should be taken to minimize the mixing in the centrifuge tube. Load 0.2 ml of the total extracts containing 2-4 mg of total protein on the top of 7-47% sucrose gradient without disturbing the surface. Note: Do not load more than 0.25 ml of the total extracts! Centrifuge for 150 min at 220,000 x g (39,000 rpm for rotor SW41) at 4 °C. Before spin is complete, set up to analyze gradient(s). Standardize absorbance detector with a 1x buffer B. Set baseline according to the Instruction Manual. Note: Before putting first gradient on make sure the pump line is filled with foni-inert so that no bubbles can enter sample - this will destroy the gradient! Try briefly raising the needle and running 1 ml of foni-inert into the base cup just prior to first fractionation. Carefully remove gradients and store at 4 °C without disturbing. Gradients must be fractionated before they start to diffuse. Insert first gradient snugly into top of fractionator [Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO)] and raise lower platform to base of tube, and screw-lock. Slowly screw up needle into bottom of gradient tube (Figure 3). Run the pump. Figure 3. Fractionation of polysome gradients. Pierce the tube with the needle. Using a peristaltic pump, extrude the gradient from the tube with a foni-inert through a spectrophotometer that monitors the absorbance at 254 nm, and then fractionated into eppendorf tubes. End run when first droplets of foni-inert are collected at end of gradient, then put the pump in the reverse mode and pump back most of the foni-inert for reuse. Be careful that no new air bubbles are introduced into pump line and needle during this procedure. Clean up after fractionating all parts of the gradient fractionation system. Rinse entire system with water, then with 20% ethanol. Clean up bench and equipment. Discard waste solutions and trash. Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO) Isco Type 6 Optical Unit: Use 254 nm filter and source screen UA-5 Absorbance Detector Settings: Chart Speed: 30-60 cm/h Sensitivity: 1.0 or 2.0 (A260 Units = Full scale) Slope Sensitivity = High Pump: Setting 40, clockwise Fraction Collector: (if desired) Use 1.5 ml microfuge tubes inside larger glass tubes Collect 0.4 min drops (0.75 ml) Take 0.4 ml of fraction (the rest freeze) and add 60 μl of 100% TCA, incubate for 10 min on ice. Spin at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aspirate all traces of TCA and resuspend the pellets in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Load 10 μl on SDS-PAGE Note: In case of polysomes disruption, polysomes were dissociated by treatment with 25 mM EDTA added instead of CHX, in the buffer A and in the gradient.."

        "@value": "Using Imaging Flow Cytometry to Characterize Extracellular Vesicles Isolated from Cell Culture Media, Plasma or Urine. The ability to non-invasively detect specific damage to the kidney has been limited. Identification of extracellular vesicles released by cells, especially when under duress, might allow for monitoring and identification of specific cell types within the kidney that are stressed. We have adapted a previously published traditional flow cytometry method for use with an imaging flow cytometer (Amnis FlowSight) for identifying EV released by specific cell types and excreted into the urine or blood using markers characteristic of particular cells in the kidney. Here we present a protocol utilizing the Amnis FlowSight Imaging Flow Cytometer to identify and quantify EV from the urine of patients with essential hypertension and renovascular disease. Notably, EV isolated from cell culture media and plasma can also be analyzed similarly.. EV isolation Note: EVs were isolated from whole urine using Total Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Urine samples (1,000 μl) were centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cells and debris. Urine supernatants (800 μl) were mixed with 1 volume (800 μl) of the Total Exosome Isolation reagent and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Other samples (Plasma, serum, cell culture media) can be prepared similarly using the manufacturer’s recommendations for reagent volume, incubation time, and temperature. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed using 1 ml pipettor and discarded. Pelleted exosomes were resuspended in 50 μl EV buffer (2 mol/L sucrose and 500 mmol/L MES [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid] solution). Store at -80 °C. Samples are considered to be stable for at least 6 months (Mendt et al., 2018). EV staining and antibody labeling Start up and Calibrate FlowSight. Thaw samples on ice. Prepare 5 mM solution of Tag-It VioletTM by adding 50 μl DMSO to one tube of Tag-It VioletTM as in the Recipe 2 Tag-It Violet marks the EV by binding to the interior proteins, thus labeling the EVs, which are too small for brightfield visualization. Pipet 20 μl EVs using 20 μl pipettor into 1.5 ml opaque Black microcentrifuge tubes, to protect samples from light. The incubated vortexer has a clear lid and is often located in the main laboratory, thus the black tubes protect the fluorescent dyes from photobleaching during the incubations. Include one sample of EVs that will be stained only with Tag-It Violet for single color compensation control. Add 30 μl dPBS to each sample using a 100 μl pipettor. Add 0.5 μl of 5 mM TIV stock to EVs (50 μM final concentration) using a 2 μl pipettor. Incubate EV for 2 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm using MultiTherm incubated vortexer. Add antibodies (for example peritubular capillary identification) using a 10 μl pipettor. 3 μl PL-VAP(LSBio) 4 μl CD31 (Biolegend) 3 μl CD144 (Biolegend) Incubate for 1 h at RT at 250 rpm in MultiTherm incubated vortexer. Data acquisition using FlowSight Acquisition is performed using FlowSight Imaging Flow Cytometer (Amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA) equipped with Amnis INSPIRE` software. Vortex sample for 10-20 s before loading onto FlowSight. Instrument setup: Lasers (all set to full power): 405 nm 100 mW 488 nm 60 mW 642 nm 100 mW 785 nm (SSC) 70 mW Acquire at least 100,000 TIV positive events. Prepare single color control compensation beads for antibodies. In 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes add 1 drop AbC capture beads. Add one antibody per tube with volume indicated in Step B8. Incubate at Room Temp for 15 min protected from light. After adding 1 ml dPBS, vortex and spin at 250 x g for 5 min using a 1000 μl pipettor. Remove supernatant. Add one drop AbC negative beads and 50 μl dPBS. Vortex and run on FlowSight. Acquire 1000 events with Brightfield off (for compensation). Acquire 1000-5000 events with Brightfield on to aid in initial gate determination. Samples are run in the following order. TIV only EVs Acquire 1000 events with Brightfield off (for compensation). Acquire 1000-5000 events with Brightfield on to aid in initial gate determination. Antibody single color controls (acquired as in Step C5g above) Samples with TIV and all antibodies (Brightfield is on). Extracellular vehicles (EVs) are released from cells under normal conditions and their numbers are known to increase when the cells are exposed to stress conditions. Therefore, levels of urinary EVs have been shown to be associated with various kidney disorders such as polycystic kidney disease (Hogan et al., 2009), acute kidney injury (Aghajani Nargesi et al., 2017; Cappuccilli et al., 2018), and various glomerular diseases (Zhang et al., 2019).We have previously shown that levels of EVs that are increased in patients with hypertension likely originate from podocytes (Kwon et al., 2017) and peritubular capillaries (PTC) (Sun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). We have also recently shown that urinary levels of EVs reflecting renal cellular senescence are altered in these patients (Santelli et al., 2019). We describe here a more detailed protocol that can be used for the isolation and quantitative characterization of EVs isolated from cell culture media, plasma, and urine (Kwon et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Conley et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). The primary advantages of this method of EV isolation are shorter processing time and obviating the requirement for an ultracentrifuge to isolate the EVs."

Vortex and transfer 1 ml to another microfuge tube. Test OD600 for an accurate reading, the OD should be between 0.1 and 0.5. Dilute the rest of the suspension to 16 OD600, around 1.6 x 106 cells per ml, 1,600 cells per μl. That is 4,800 or 5,000 cells per 3 μl. Spot 3 μl cells on each position. If using OmniTray, start with the 1st column (8 wells in each column). Do 5 fold serial dilution from the 1st to 5th column. Leave the 6th column empty. Transfer another 8 strains culture into the 7th column and do another 5 fold dilution.."

        "@value": "Flow Cytometric Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules containing hydroxyl radicals or peroxides with unpaired electrons. In healthy aerobic cells, ROS are produced naturally as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, oxidoreductase enzymes, or metal catalyzed oxidation at a controlled rate. However, ROS can be induced under some stress conditions especially exposure to environmental oxidants and certain drugs that leads to oxidative stress. Exceed ROS can cause damages in the building blocks of cells including DNA, proteins, and lipids, and eventually results in cell death. Cell-permeant 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) is a widely used ROS indicator. The reduced non-fluorescent fluorescein H2DCFDA can be oxidized and converted into fluorescent 2’, 7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by intracellular ROS. In this protocol, we applied H2DCFDA to label the intracellular ROS and detected the DCF intensity by flow cytometry.. Cells were cultured with complete medium in a 6 cm dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with NAC or H2O2 after reaching 70-90% confluency. ROS scavenger NAC is a precursor to cysteine and glutathione which are strong antioxidants; while H2O2 is a compound with an oxygen-oxygen single bond and is known as a strong oxidizer. (For negative control) Incubate cells with freshly prepared 5 mM NAC in culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C after three time washes of pre-warmed DPBS. (For positive control) Incubate cells with freshly prepared 0.1 mM H2O2 from 1 M stock in DPBS for 20 min at 37 °C after three time washes of pre-warmed DPBS. Dilute the H2DCFDA stock solutions into DPBS to make 0.1 μM working solution. Cells were harvested by trypsinization. Suspend cells in working solution at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min and protect from light. Centrifuge the tubes at 130 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in pre-warmed DPBS. Repeat the wash steps 8 and 9 twice. Submit samples to flow cytometry for ROS detection using the 488 nm laser for excitation and detected at 535 nm.."

        "@value": "Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells to Neuronal Cells Using Hanging Droplets and Retinoic Acid. Controlled differentiation of embryonic stem cells is an essential tool in stem cell research. In this protocol, we describe a simple differentiation protocol involving the induction of embryoid body formation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) using hanging droplets, followed by differentiation into a neuronal lineage.. Coating of plates Add enough 0.1% Gelatin to cover the bottom of a tissue-culture treated flask or plate (for example, 1.5 ml of 0.1% Gelatin for a T25 flask). Incubate for at least 10 min at room temperature or 37 °C. Carefully remove the 0.1% Gelatin and add mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) medium (see Recipes). Note: Washing plates is not necessary when carefully removing gelatin. Recovery of cells from liquid nitrogen Prepare suitable plate as described above. Collect cryo tube with mESCs from liquid nitrogen and quickly thaw in a water bath at 37 °C. Slowly add culture medium with LIF to cells in cryo tube and transfer to a 15 ml tube with approximately 10 ml of medium with LIF. Note: Slowly adding medium to ESCs prevents damage due to sudden changes in osmotic pressure. Pellet cells for 5 min at 200 x g and remove supernatant Resuspend cells in appropriate amount of medium with LIF and add to gelatin-coated plate. Maintaining and splitting mESCs Remove mESC medium from flask or plate and wash cells with PBS. Note: See Figure 1 for example of v6.5 cells ready for splitting. Figure 1. Confluent v6.5 mESCs. Scale bar = 50 µm. Remove PBS carefully and add enough 0.05% Trypsin (see Recipes) to cover cells (for example, 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin in a T25 flask). Incubate at 37 °C. Usually 3-5 min is enough for all cells to dissociate. Note: Do not leave mESCs in trypsin for too long as it will harm the cells. Transfer the required number of cells to a new flask with the appropriate amount of mESC medium containing LIF. Trypsin can be removed by centrifugation, but this is not necessary for v6.5 cells. Note: Take care when pipetting mESCs with small (non-serological) pipette tips, they can be easily damaged. Split mESCs every 2-3 days, avoid letting mESCs getting over-confluent. Note: Avoid culturing mESCs for more than 10 passages. Preparing embryoid bodies (EBs) using hanging droplets (Day 1, see also Video 1 for Steps B5-B7) Trypsinize mESCs as described above, be sure to have single cells. Resuspend in mESC medium without LIF. Carefully count the cells using a hemocytometer or any other preferred method. Adjust concentration to approximately 2 x 104 cells/ml using mESC medium without LIF. Note: Slight deviations from this concentration is not a problem. Using a multichannel pipette, place 20 µl droplets of the cell suspension on the inside of a plastic Petri dish lid (not tissue-culture treated and not gelatin-coated). We aim for approximately 100 droplets on a 90 mm plate but depending on how many EBs are required, the size of the dish can be easily scaled up or down. Note: Avoid touching the surface of the Petri dish with the pipette tip as this tends to make the droplets flatter and more spread out. Video 1. Preparation of hanging droplets on Petri dish Add 10 ml of water or PBS to the bottom half of the Petri dish to prevent desiccation. In one smooth movement, turn the lid with the droplets upside down and place on top of the bottom part of the Petri dish containing water or PBS. Place in 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h (Day 3). EB formation can be observed directly using a non-inverted microscope or using an inverted microscope by placing the lid with hanging droplets onto the empty bottom part of a Petri dish followed by carefully inverting the Petri dish. EBs should form within 24 h. See Figure 2 for example of EBs of v6.5 cells 24 h after preparation of hanging droplets. Note: Differentiation can be confirmed by measuring the downregulation of pluripotency markers such as Nanog, Pou5f1 and Sox2 by quantitative real time PCR or Western blot. Figure 2. Typical morphology of embryoid body. v6.5 cells were cultured in hanging droplets in mESC medium without LIF for 24 h (left) and 48 h (right). Differentiation of EBs using retinoic acid After 48 h in droplets, the EBs are collected by adding PBS to the Petri dish lids and collecting the supernatant containing the EBs. Note: It might require some pipetting up and down to dislodge all the EBs as they tend to stick to the plastic surface. Use serological pipettes as smaller pipettes are likely to damage the EBs. The supernatant containing EBs can be collected in either 15 or 50 ml tubes depending on the volume used. Leave the tubes upright for 5 min or more to allow the EBs to settle on the bottom of the tubes. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the EBs in 10 ml mESC medium without LIF. Add the 10 ml EB suspension to a 90 mm Petri dish (not culture treated and not gelatin-coated) and grow for another 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (day 5). Note: The resuspension volume and size of the plate can be adjusted to the number of EBs required, we aim for approximately 100 EBs/90 mm dish. After 48 h of incubation, replace the medium with 10 ml of fresh mESC medium without LIF using the method described in Steps E2 and E3 and add Retinoic acid to a final concentration of 250 nM. Note: The concentration of Retinoic acid is likely to be cell line dependent. Continue to culture for another 7 days (Day 12) whilst replacing the medium with fresh mESC medium without LIF supplemented with 250 nM retinoic acid every 2 days. See Figure 3 for example of EB 7 days after RA treatment. Figure 3. Embryoid bodies after 7 days of retinoic acid treatment. Scale bar = 500 µm. After these 7 days (on Day 12), the EBs can be collected as described in Steps D2 and D3 and seeded on tissue-cultured treated, gelatin-coated plates or flasks. At this point, EBs will attach and cells will start to migrate from the EBs within 24 h. See Figure 4 for example of EB 24 h after attachment to gelatin-coated plate and Figure 5 for EBs 7 days after attachment, showing considerable migration and growth of cells of neuronal lineage. Figure 4. Embryoid bodies 24 h after plating on gelatin-coated plates showing migration of differentiated cells from embryoid body. Scale bar = 500 µm. At this point, the cells are differentiated into cells of neuronal lineage and can be directly used for further experiments or frozen down. Note: Differentiation into cell of neuronal lineage can be verified through measuring gene expression of genes such as Neurog2, Gata4, Gata6, Nestin, Sox1 and TuJ1 by quantitative real time PCR or Western blot (Ying et al., 2003; Witteveldt et al., 2019). To ensure a homogeneously differentiated population, lineage selection by cell-sorting based on fluorophore-expression driven by lineage-specific promoters or immune-isolation by lineage-specific extracellular markers (Jüngling et al., 2003; Ladewig et al., 2008) might be necessary. When multiple replicates are required we suggest to differentiate individual replicates. Figure 5. Embryoid bodies 7 days after plating on gelatin coated plates showing migration and growth of differentiated cells of neuronal lineage with clearly changed morphology. Scale bar = 20 µm.. One of the major achievements in embryonic stem cell research has been the ability to direct the differentiation of stem cells into specific developmental lineages and ultimately terminally differentiated cells. To preserve pluripotency of mESCs in in vitro culture, cells are grown in the presence of the Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine, which promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation. A common method to direct stem cell differentiation into all three germ layer lineages is to remove LIF from the culture medium and forcing the formation of complex three-dimensional cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs) (Itskovitz-Eldor et al., 2000). Differentiation in these embryoid bodies is considered to be disorganized, however mESC culture in the absence of LIF and in the presence of certain stimuli can result in more specific cell types, including insulin-producing cells, hematopoietic cells and neuronal cells. Differentiation of ESCs into neural lineage involves the manipulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor and Wnt signaling in the absence of Bone morphogenetic protein signaling activity (Abranches et al., 2009). Common methods involve co-culture of ESCs on stromal feeder cells or conditioned medium or direct manipulation of the essential signaling pathways which can be quite involved and time-consuming. A more straightforward method is by incubating ESCs with the natural metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid which acts on nuclear receptors to induce transcription of specific target genes. Retinoic acid has been shown to play a directing role in neural development in early stages of central nervous system development and is considered the most important extrinsic inductive signals for neural differentiation. In this protocol, we describe an efficient method to produce mouse-derived EBs and consequent neuronal differentiation using hanging droplets and retinoic acid (Jones-Villeneuve et al., 1983; Wobus et al., 1991)."

        "@value": "Use of the Vsoc-maze to Study Sociability and Preference for Social Novelty in Rodents. Studying social behavior in mouse models empowers the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved, which are affected in neuropsychiatric disorders, allowing the evaluation of therapeutic strategies. Behavioral methods available are time-consuming and reducing the length of behavioral sessions may render more manageable experiments and reduce animal stress. We validated a new reliable and sensitive method to study two features of social behavior (sociability and preference for social novelty) in two strains of male mice, the C57BL/6J inbreed strain and the CD1 (ICR) outbreed strain, using a modified version of the V-shaped maze (Vsoc-maze). The Vsoc-maze for sociability and preference for social novelty improves time performance by shortening the length of the sessions, and reduces variability compared to the classical approach performed in the three-chamber apparatus. Altogether, the Vsoc-maze allows evaluating the specific alterations of social behavior in mice in a time-efficient and reproducible manner.. Habituation session (Phase I) The habituation session allows mice to freely explore and familiarize with the Vsoc-maze. To record the whole experiment, turn on the video recording system. Place the experimental mouse by lifting the Vsoc-maze, with the chambers empty, at the starting point (crossing-point between both arms). Let the experimental mouse explore the maze for 5 min. During this time, use two stopwatches and assign each stopwatch to count the exploration time of each chamber. Then, measure the exploration time for each chamber through the image obtained by the closed-circuit camera. At the end of the session, record the time exploring each empty chamber. Notes: It is not necessary to turn off the video recording and/or the data acquisition system. There is no need to move the experimental mouse from the Vsoc-maze. Although in our experience it would not be necessary, an inter-trial period could be included in which the experimental mouse is removed from the Vsoc-maze after habituation. During the inter-trial period the stranger 1 (STR 1) is placed in the chamber (see Sociability session, Phase II). Performing this inter-trial period may avoid experimenter’s manipulation of the maze while the experimental mouse is inside the Vsoc-maze. Moreover, it would allow cleaning any urine or defecation in the Vsoc-maze which may affect the exploratory behavior of the experimental mouse during the next Phases of the procedure. Sociability session (Phase II) The sociability session is performed just after the habituation session. A juvenile mouse assigned as (STR 1) is placed in one of the small chambers located at the end of one of the corridors (both corridors were alternated during the experiments). The mouse is placed in the chamber from the top of the maze, before placing the lid of the chamber. The sociability session lasts 5 min. Use the stopwatches to count the time that the experimental mouse spends exploring each chamber. A preference for spending more time exploring the chamber with the STR 1 than the empty chamber should be obvious. This juvenile mouse was used as STR 1 for all the experiment. At the end of the sociability session, record the exploration times for both chambers. Maintain the experimental mouse and STR 1 in the Vsoc-maze and start the last phase of the test. Notes: An inter-trial period between Phase II and III could be included, where the experimental mouse is removed from the Vsoc-maze. Alternatively, the STR 1 may be changed to the previously empty chamber before introducing STR 2 in the chamber previously occupied by STR 1. Under these conditions the experimenter can be confident that the exploration time devoted to STR 1 and STR 2 in the next Phase is due to a social novelty preference rather than spatial novelty (new STR 2 in previously empty chamber). Additionally, Phase II may be extended beyond 5 min in the case that social habituation-dishabituation behavior may be studied. Experimental mice may reduce the interest for exploring STR 1 as the Phase II progresses, as shown elsewhere (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014). By running Phase II for longer, a decay in exploration as a function of session time can be revealed. Preference for social novelty session (Phase III) The preference for social novelty session is performed just after the sociability session. The test session lasts 5 min. A second novel mouse assigned as stranger 2 (STR 2) is placed from the top inside the previously empty chamber, while the STR 1 remains inside the same chamber. During test time the experimental mouse is allowed to explore all the apparatus. This juvenile mouse was used as STR 2 for all the experiment. Use the stopwatches to count the time that the experimental mouse spends exploring each chamber. A preference for spending more time exploring the chamber with the STR 2, which is the novel mouse, than the STR 1, the familiar mouse should be obvious. Post-test cleaning session Remove the experimental mouse and the stranger mice from the apparatus by lifting the whole maze, and return mice to their home cage. Clean the maze with 30% (vol/vol) ethanol to avoid olfactory cues. Do the test with another animal if it is necessary (back to step 2 in Habituation session [Phase I]). When the data acquisition for the Whole experiment is finished, export the experimental data and analyze the results (see Data analysis).. Social behaviors are important in numerous species to establish the networks and relationships that define social communities (Berry and Bronson, 1992). Among those behaviors, sociability is defined as the tendency to seek out social interaction (Caldwell, 2012). Some neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) display a marked alteration in sociability combined with other features (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This characteristic highlights the need for experimental behavioral settings in animal models to address the research on such complex multi-facetted disorders (Caldwell, 2012). Mus musculus is a social specie showing reciprocal social interactions, sexual and parenting behaviors, territorial scent marking and aggressive behaviors (Ricceri et al., 2007; Silverman et al., 2010). The wide repertoire of mouse behaviors makes this specie suitable for modeling human disorders characterized by disruptions in social recognition and social behavior (Crawley, 2004; Yang et al., 2007). Such rodent models warrant the evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches for treatment (Moy et al., 2004). Commonly, mice conserve a characteristic pattern of social behavior, initiating social contact and approach when exposed to an unfamiliar conspecific (Moy et al., 2004).Several paradigms have been described to measure social behavior in mouse models (Silverman et al., 2010). Among those, the most common is the Crawley’s sociability test also called three-chamber apparatus (Chadman et al., 2008; McFarlane et al., 2008; Moy et al., 2008), which allows to study two different parameters: sociability and preference for social novelty. Sociability is defined as the tendency of the experimental mouse to spend more time exploring an unfamiliar mouse than exploring an object or an empty chamber. Instead, preference for social novelty is defined as the propensity to spend more time exploring a new unfamiliar mouse than the now-familiar mouse that was explored in the sociability phase (Moy et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2011). Due to the length of the different phases in the Crawley’s sociability test, the procedure is time-consuming and experimental variability is sometimes troublesome.We have adapted a V-maze, previously used successfully to evaluate novel object-recognition memory (Puighermanal et al., 2009; Busquets-Garcia et al., 2011 and 2013; Navarro-Romero et al., 2019), to assess social behavior. We found that the procedure using this new maze (Vsoc-maze) provides an advantageous approach in terms of time, while maintaining accuracy, to reveal particular social phenotypes in two mouse lines frequently used in biomedical research."

        "@value": "ADCC Assay Protocol. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) bridges innate and adaptive immunity, and it involves both humoral and cellular immune responses. ADCC has been found to be a main route of immune protection against viral infections and cancers in vivo. Here we developed a flow cytometry based protocol for ADCC assay using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells. Using this protocol, we determined the ADCC activity of convalescent plasma IgGs from six H1N1-infected human subjects in China, and identified two dominant ADCC epitopes, designated E1 [amino acid (AA) 92-117] and E2 (AA 124-159), on haemagglutinin of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus by epitope mapping of the convalescent plasma IgGs with different levels of ADCC activity. Our study may aid in designing immunogens that can elicit antibodies with high ADCC activity. Vaccine immunogens designed to include the structural determinants of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies and ADCC epitopes may confer a comprehensive immune protection against viral infections.. Preperation of Target Cells Infect Raji cells at a MOI 2, 48 h before assay with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) influenza virus in BSL-3 facility at a multiplicity to give about 80-95% infected cells. Detail procedure in Note 4. Take a sample of target cells 48 h after infection in order to assess the incidence of infected cells through its ability to produce hem-agglutination with Turkey red blood cells and binding with polyclonal antibodies. Detail procedure in Note 5. 2 x 106 cells washed twice with PBS. PKH67 cell labelling performed as per the protocol for General Cell Membrane Labelling by Sigma-Aldrich. Preparation of Effector Cells (Isolation of PBMCs) Isolate PBMCs from Blood samples of healthy volunteers, according to method given by Panda and Ravindran (2013). Wash twice isolated PBMCs with PBS. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays (ADCC) Antibody-dependent cell toxicity was determined using the flow-cytometry based method employing the principle of live and dead cell discrimination (Srivastava et al., 2013). Dispense 5.0 x 104 labelled target cells in 50 μl RPMI 1640 media in each well as per the layout given bellow in round-bottomed 96 well plate in duplicate. Add 50 μl of antibodies (total IgGs from plasma of infected patients 1μg/ml and/or 5 μg/ml resulting in 0.5 μg/ml and 2.5 μg/ml) to the wells as per layout. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. Add unlabelled normal PBMC effector cells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640/0.5% Pen/Strep at a concentration of 2.5 x 107 cells/ml to each well as per the layout. Incubate cells for 2 h at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. After 2 h add 1 µl of the fluorescent dead cell dye 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD). Incubate at 4 °C in dark for 20 min. Analyse cells on FACS machine. A total of 5,000 target cells acquire. Determine percentage cell death by software analysis of four identifiable cell populations, live effector cells (no dye), dead effector cells (7-AAD only), live target cells (PKH-67 only) and dead target cells (PKH-67 and 7-AAD). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Unstained Target Cells Unstained Effector Cells PKH67 Stained Target Cells 7AAD Stained Target Cells PKH67 Stained Target Cells + media + 7AAD Stain PKH67 Stained Target Cells + 5 µl 1% Triton X-100 + 7AAD Stain PKH67 Stained Target Cells + Antibody + 7AAD Stain FACS analysis step Identify total (Live and dead) target cell zone (FSC Vs SSC) (5,000) (Well no 1).

        "@value": "Tensile Testing Assay for the Measurement of Tissue Stiffness in Arabidopsis Inflorescence Stem. Lignocellulosic biomass is a versatile renewable resource for fuels, buildings, crafts, and biomaterials. Strategies of molecularly designing lignocellulose for industrial application has been developed by the discoveries of novel genes after the screenings of various mutants and transformed lines of Arabidopsis whose cell walls could be modified in the inflorescence stem, a model woody tissue. The mechanical properties are used as a quantitative index for the chemorehological behavior of the genetically modified cell wall in the tissue. This parameter can be measured with tensile or bending tests of tissue explants, the vibration analysis of tissue behavior or using atomic force microscopy to probe the tissue surface. Here, we describe in detail the procedure to determine the stiffness of methanol-fixed, rehydrated and pronase-treated inflorescence explants with a tensile testing machine based on classical methods for the determination of cell wall extensibility.. Plant material preparation (requires 2-3 days after the harvest of tissue) Excise the basal parts (roughly 30 mm from bottom of stem) of inflorescence stems from 8 week-old Arabidopsis with scissors (Figures 4A-4C) and immediately and completely submerged the whole part of explant in 40 ml methanol in PYREX® 55 ml screw cap culture tubes. Plants are grown under 16-h light (60-80 μmol m-2 s-1)/8-h dark cycle in a constant 23 °C plant room with no humidity control. Note: More than fifteen explants of inflorescence stem are necessary for the evaluation of one plant line (see Note 2). Figure 4. Stem segment taken from basal part of the inflorescence stem of Arabidopsis. A. Eight-weeks old plant grown in soil. The basal end was cut at the position of red arrowhead with a pair of scissors. B. Harvested and fresh inflorescence stem. Excised stem segment which should be cut at the position of arrowhead. All branches should be removed. C. Digested fresh segment of inflorescence stem which should be submerged into methanol immediately. D. 30 mm-length inflorescence-stem segment after boiled in methanol, rehydration and Pronase E. Treatment. Longitudinal and vertical lengths of each sample should be determined later by Image J. Close the cap of culture tube tightly to avoid a methanol explosion from the tube during the heat treatment described in Step A3. Put the Pyrex glass tubes containing explants dipped in methanol into the water bath at 80 °C in the chemical fume hood. Incubate them for 15 min (see Note 3). After cooling the tubes at room temperature, discard the green-colored methanol extract and add 40 ml of fresh methanol to the glass tube. Repeat Steps A3 and A4 until explants become white at least more than five times. Wash the methanol-fixed explants with SDW more than five times to remove methanol. Note: Make sure all explants sink to the bottom in SDW. If some explants are floating in the tube, stand for 5 min and change SDW again. Discard SDW completely in the tube with a plastic transfer pipet. Note: Don’t touch the tissue explants by a transfer pipet to avoid destruction of tissues. Add 40 ml of the Pronase E (PE) solution (see Recipes), which is pre-incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before use, to a glass tube. Note: Pre-incubation is essential to deactivate the glycosyl hydrolase contaminants in the PE products. Make sure all explants sink to the bottom of 50 ml glass tube in the PE solution. Incubate the glass tube containing explants in PE solution with tightly capped lids in the oven at 37 °C for 18 h (see Note 4). Discard PE solution from the tube. Wash the PE-treated explants with SDW more than three times and remove the remaining solution from the 50 ml-glass tube as much as possible with a plastic transfer pipet. Note: Don’t touch the tissue explants with a transfer pipet to devoid any destruction of tissues. Trim the basal end of explants with a razor blade to make them exactly 30 mm in length (Figure 4D). Determine the force and displacement curve of inflorescence explant (Procedure B) or store the 30 mm-length tissue explants in methanol at room temperature until use. Wash the explants with SDW at least three times before the experiment if the explants are stored in methanol (Step 10 of Procedure B) Determination of the force and displacement curve of inflorescence explants (ca. 5 min for the measurement of one sample). Turn on the tensile tester and the computer (Figure 3A) Set the “tensile test mode” in the operation software and the data sampling method to X-T mode with the maximal resolution of distance (0.001 mm) according to the manufacturer's manual. Set the initial distance between upper (top) and lower (bottom) fiber clamps to 10 mm after setting the upper clamp (without sample) to the original position (Figures 3B and 6F). Calibrate the load cell (at both 0% and 50% of 10 N) without removing the upper removable clamp according to the manufacturer's manual (Figure 3B). Set the speed of upper movable clamp to 2 mm/min. Set the maximum load to 1 N (ca. 100 g) which is the load when the test is finished. Set the program to return upper movable clamp to the initial position after the test. Designate the data file format and enter the plant-line name of samples and the test number. Prepare 2 ml-micro tubes containing 2 ml fresh methanol in tube rack. Protect the tube label (plant line name and test number) from methanol with transparent tape. If samples have been stored in methanol prior to the test, wash and rehydrate the 30 mm length explants by at least five changes of SDW. Make sure all tissue explants sink to the bottom of the glass tube after the rehydration. Transfer tissue explants into the plastic Petri dish containing 40 ml SDW from the glass tube and keep them in the SDW until needed for the test. Take a tissue explant out from the SDW and immediately take a photograph of the tissue explant with a ruler and the label of the test number and sample name with a digital camera (Figure 4D). Determine the longitudinal and vertical lengths of explants later. Note: Avoid drying the sample from Steps B12 to B24. Put the tissue explant on Kimtowel wiper to remove excess water on the surface of the explant. Put the 2 mm x ca.10 mm strips of Kimwipe on both ends of the tissue explant (Figure 5A). Fold each paper strip at the middle to hold the both edges of the tissue explant (Figure 5B). Note: These paper strips are necessary to prevent tissue slippage in the fiber clamps during the test. Figure 5. Two small paper strips of Kimwipe are used to prevent the sample slippage in the clamps. A. After putting two paper strips under the sample, fold two paper fragments in the middle to the direction of red arrows. B. After that, fix the parts of the sample, which are indicated by blue boxes, with the upper and lower clamps. Fix one side of the paper strip-covered parts of the explant (Figure 5B) with the removable clamp by the lever action. Make sure the longitudinal axis of the tissue is vertically positioned at the center of the upper clamp (Figures 6A and 6B). Tighten the hand screw of the upper clamp to fix the tissue more. Do not tighten the screw completely to avoid destruction of the tissue (Figure 3C). Make sure the top-removable clamp fitting to the sample without any gap (upper arrowhead in Figure 6C) and any distortion (lower arrowhead and white dashed lines in Figure 6C). The gap and distortion could cause slightly wavy fluctuation of force extension curve during the tensile test. If gap and distortion are found, adjust the clamps and the sample by pushing the attachments of clamp with your thumbs (Figures 6D and 6E). This adjustment is also necessary to fix the sample with the bottom-fixed clamp in Steps B18 and B19. Figure 6. Tissue sample fastened between two clamps. A. Fix the sample with the upper removable clamp first (front view). See the position of one end of sample (Arrowhead). B. Make sure the angle between the sample and the edge of the upper clamp is ca. 90 degree (Side view). C-E. Make sure the top-removable and bottom-fixed clamps fitting to the sample without any gap (indicated by the upper arrowhead in C) and any distortion (indicated by the lower arrowhead and white dashed line in C). F and G. After hanging the upper clamp with the sample on the hook of the load cell, fix the sample with the lower clamp. Make sure both upper and lower ends of the sample protruding from clamps a little (Arrowheads in G). Hang the upper clamp with the explant on the hook of the loading cell. Fix another side of the paper strip-covered part of the explant with the lower clamp (Figure 6F). Make sure the longitudinal axis of the tissue is vertically positioned at the center of the lower clamp as for the upper clamp. Both ends of the sample should extrude a little from the clamps (Arrowheads in Figure 6G). Tighten the hand screw of the lower clamp to fix the tissue securely (Figure 3C). Do not tighten the screw completely to avoid destruction of the tissue (see Note 5). Make sure the load between two clamps is almost 0 N (From -0.042 to 0.0183 N, Mean and standard deviation: -0.0059 N ± 0.0092 in our experiments) in order to avoid prestreching before the test. A strong prestrech could cause the plastic deformation of the sample before the estimation of stiffness (Cleland, 1967). If the load value before the test is not ignorable, loosen the hand screw of the lower clamp slightly. Repeat Steps B18 and B19 to get the load value close to 0. Alternatively, change the distance between two clamps to shorter than 10 mm with a manual controller (Figure 1A) to let the load value close to zero without touching the lower clamp (-0.01 mm to 0.05 mm in our experiments). In the latter case, record the changed distance between two clamps. Start loading the sample to 1 N by lifting the upper clamp. After reaching to 1 N, the loading should be stopped mechanically and the upper clamp should return to the initial position (10 mm distance) immediately. Prepare the next sample during this process (from Step B12). After the return of the upper and movable clamp to its original position, remove the tested sample from the upper and lower clamps by loosening the hand screws and levering action. Store each tested sample in methanol in a numbered 2 ml-micro tube. Repeat these steps (from Step B12 to Step B25) for all samples in one plant line. Store the series of all data for one plant line and export the relationship between displacement (mm) and load (N) for all samples in text format. The text data files should be analyzed with Microsoft Excel software or equivalent software (see Data analysis). Turn off the tensile testing machine and the computer. Determination of the sample dry weight Discard methanol from the 2 ml-microtubes containing a tissue explant (stored in Step B24) with a plastic transfer pipet avoiding destruction of the sample. Place the 2 ml-microtubes in the oven at 60 °C for 2 days without capping but with a small piece of aluminum foil sheet to prevent dust contamination. Weigh the dried tested sample with an analytical balance equipped with an anti-static apparatus and the custom-made wind-proof cover (Note 6).. Plant biomechanics can be measured with different methods such as a tensile test (Burgert et al., 2003; Cosgrove, 2011), a bending test (Shah et al., 2017), vibration analysis (Niklas and Moon, 1988, Nakata et al., 2018) and atomic force microscopy (Radotić et al., 2012). These techniques are available to quantify the stiffness and strength properties of materials. Stiffness is defined by the force required to displace (stretch) the material over a unit length, while the strength is regarded as the amount of force required to ultimately rupture the material. The stiffness of a structure is affected by the material properties such as lignocellulosic composition and the bio-structural geometry such as a thickness of cell wall (Shah et al., 2017). The biomechanical tests designed to measure these properties are frequently used in timber grading for commercial sale as well as in tree breeding programs to select and breed superior trees with increased stiffness and strength. Such tests can be also used in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify candidate genes with effects on strength and stiffness in mutant screening as a wood model (Strabala and MacMillan, 2013, Figures 1A-1C). In fact, the tensile test was used to estimate the stiffness of inflorescence stems in Arabidopsis in our previous study (Sakamoto et al., 2018). The protocol in this article provides the procedure to measure the stiffness of mature regions of Arabidopsis inflorescence stem with a tensile testing machine (Figure 1D). It is based on the method to measure the cell wall extensibility (compliance) of tissue explants of dicot seedling stems and monocot coleoptiles (Olson et al., 1965; Cleland, 1967) performed intensively between the 1960s and the 1980s (Taiz, 1984; Masuda, 1990). This has been optimized to the determination of the stiffness of inflorescence stem in Arabidopsis and described in this article.Figure 1.

Myofiber isolation followed with ex vivo culture could recapitulate and visualize satellite cells (SCs) activation, proliferation, and differentiation. This approach could be taken to understand the physiology of satellite cells and the molecular mechanism of regulatory factors, in terms of the involvement of intrinsic factors over SCs quiescence, activation, proliferation and differentiation. Single myofiber culture has several advantages that the traditional approach such as FASC and cryosection could not compete with. For example, myofiber isolation and culture could be used to observe SCs activation, proliferation and differentiation at a continuous manner within their physiological “niche” environment while FACS or cryosection could only capture single time-point upon external stimulation to activate satellite cells by BaCl2, Cardiotoxin or ischemia. Furthermore, in vitro transfection with siRNA or overexpression vector could be performed under ex vivo culture to understand the detailed molecular function of a specific gene on SCs physiology. With these advantages, the physiological state of SCs could be analyzed at multiple designated time-points by immunofluorescence staining. In this protocol, we provide an efficient and practical protocol to isolate single myofiber from EDL muscle, followed with ex vivo culture and immunostaining.. Preparation Cut the Glass Pasteur Pipettes (Figure 1e) to a small curved (Figure 1f) and a large (Figure 1g) pipette with a diamond pen (Figure 1d). Polish the terminal with an ethanol flame to smooth the edge. Coat pipettes with undiluted horse serum. Coat two 6-cm cell culture dishes (2 ml for each dish) and a 24-well plate (400 μl for each well) with undiluted horse serum until the entire bottom of plates was covered, followed with incubation for 1 min under a cell culture hood, and then transfer the horse serum back to the original tube and store in a 4 °C fridge. Uncover the plates and air-dry under a cell culture hood for 1 h. Cover the plates and keep them at room temperature. It is better to coat the plate on the same day of the experiment. Set the temperature of a water bath to 37 °C. Prepare washing media (following Recipe 1 and then keep it in a 37 °C water bath). In general, 50 ml washing media is enough for up to 200 myofiber isolation from one EDL muscle. Prepare collagenase solution (following Recipe 2 and then keep it in a 37 °C water bath). Each EDL requires ~1 ml dilated collagenase solution (final concentration: 0.2% w/v) in a 15 ml tube. Thaw the 4% paraformaldehyde (following Recipe 3). Plug in the heating pad. Figure 1.

This video was made at Guangdong Institute of Microbiology according to guidelines from the Guangdong Institute of Microbiology on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology under protocol [GT-IACUC201704071]. Anesthetize the experimental mice with CO2. Cut the skin below the ankle. Cut through the skin along the inner leg. Expose the muscle fascia and patella by pulling the skin up (Figure 2A). Tore the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle fascia with a tweezer. Tear off vastus lateralis over the knee, expose and cut off the origin of TA and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (Figure 2B). Separate the tendon of TA muscle using a tweezer along the inner margin of the shank. Snip the tendons with the fine scissor (Figure 2C). Gently pull it up to separate the TA muscle from the bone and expose the entire EDL muscle (Figure 2D). Cut the tendon of EDL muscle by snipping two-thirds of the lower ankle, Use one tip of the forceps to separate EDL muscle gently (Figure 2E). Place the EDL muscle in a 15 ml tube with the prewarmed collagenase solution and place it in a 37 °C water bath to incubate for 60 to 80 min until myofibers are loose but not in crimped (it depends on the efficacy of collagenase and conditions of mice). Dissect the other EDL muscle following Steps B1-B9. Figure 2. Procedures to isolate the EDL muscle.

Single Myofiber Isolation (Video 2) Video 2. Procedures to isolate myofiber from EDL muscle. This video was made at Guangdong Institute of Microbiology according to guidelines from the Guangdong Institute of Microbiology on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology under protocol GT-IACUC201704071. Transfer the digested EDL muscle to a horse serum coated 6-cm Petri dish with 5 ml prewarmed washing medium in it using the prepared big Glass Pasteur Pipette. Place the 6-cm Petri dish on the heating pad. Inhale an appropriate amount of solution from the dish. Hold the Petri dish with the right hand to adjust the position of dish. Flush the EDL muscle continuously to rotate it along its long pivots until myofibers are naturally released from EDL muscle. When a single muscle fiber is released, use a small bent glass Pasteur pipette to transfer it into a well of 24-well plate covered with 200 μl washing media. Repeat Steps C1 and C2 until the number of myofibers meets your requirement. It is recommended that the myofibers be collected within 1-h. Wash each well with 500 µl washing media three times before adding 500 µl culture media (following Recipe 4). Place the 24-well plate into a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Fixation When myofibers are cultured for 0/24/48/72-h or other different designated length of time, remove as much culture media as possible (leave the minimum amount of culture media to avoid myofibers’ exposure to the air). Fix myofibers with 500 μl 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. Aspirate the fixation buffer, and add 500 μl 50 mM glycine to incubate for 10 min to quench the fixation at room temperature. Wash myofibers with PBS for 3 times at room temperature. The fixed myofibers can be stored in a 4 °C fridge for up to a week before immunostaining (Figure 3). Figure 3. Images of isolated single myofiber after cultured for 0/24/48/72 h. Scale bars = 100 μm. Immunostaining Permeabilize myofibers with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) diluted in PBS for 10-min, followed by a 5-min wash in PBS for 3 times. Prepare blocking buffer as Recipe 5. Centrifuge the blocking buffer at 16,000 x g for 10 min in case there was any residue precipitate from goat serum. Incubate fibers with 400 μl blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Incubate with 200 μl blocking buffer containing primary antibodies of Pax7 (1:100) or MyoD (1:300) overnight at 4 °C. After night incubation with primary antibody, wash myofibers 3 times for 5-min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 to remove any unbound antibody. Incubate with 200 μl blocking buffer containing appropriate secondary antibody (1:500) for 1-h at room temperature protected from light. After 1-h incubation with secondary antibody, wash 3 times at 5 min per wash with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. Transfer each fiber to a glass slide and drain the remaining liquid. Mount the glass slide with DAPI-containing mounting medium. Cover with a cover slide and dry the glass slide for at least 10 min before imaging. Observe myofibers under a fluorescent microscope and capture images of immunostained myofibers (Figure 4). Figure 4. Representative images of single myofiber culture harvested at T0, 24, 48 and 72-h. Single myofiber with satellite cells or clusters were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against Pax7 or MyoD. Red for Pax7+ satellite cells. Purple for MyoD+ satellite cells. Blue for nucleus. Scale bar = 100 μm.. Satellite cells are considered as an adult stem cell because they maintain self-renew and remarkable postnatal regenerative potential of skeletal muscle (Collins et al., 2005). SCs are located between the basal lamina and the plasma lemma of myofibers (MAURO, 1961). Here, to isolate the single myofiber, EDL muscle is digested with the collagenase to release the connective tissue and completely dissociate the connective tissue between fibers. In 1986, it was reported that the proliferation of satellite cells on single muscle fibers were isolated from adult rats and were cultured in cell culture plate (Bischoff, 1986). It was further developed into a tissue culture system that reliably permits isolation of intact, living, single muscle fibers with associated satellite cells from predominantly fast- and slow-twitch muscles of rat or mouse (Bekoff and Betz, 1977a and 1977b; Rosenblatt et al., 1995). There are two main approaches to study SCs: single myofiber culture and primary myoblast culture prepared from mononucleated cells dissociated from whole muscle (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012). Even though, primary myoblast could be split and passaged multiple times, these primary myoblasts retain in proliferation or differentiation states. Freshly isolated single myofiber allows satellite cells to stay beneath the basal lamina at quiescent state, followed with activation by either internal environment or external factors. There are several improvements for myofiber isolation and culture in recent years (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012; Pasut et al., 2013; Gallot et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2018). However, the difficulty of myofiber isolation and ex vivo culture prevent further application of this reliable and practical method. In the current protocol, we optimized reagents used for single myofiber isolation and improved procedures to make it even more simple and easy to repeat from hand to hand. Since satellite cells are sensitive to various factors, we describe a relatively simple, detailed and efficient approach to isolate and culture single myofiber. Based on our protocol, state and function of satellite cells could be analyzed from mice with different genotypes. Different manipulation such as transfection, and drug treatment on myofibers, followed with the downstream procedures including but not limited to myofiber transplantation and immunostaining could be performed. These additional manipulations could not be performed in these approaches such as FASC or cryosection."

        "@value": "ATAC-seq on Sorted Adult Mouse Neurons. Transcription regulation is a key aspect of cellular identity established during development and maintained into adulthood. Molecular and biochemical assays that probe the genome are critical tools in exploring mechanisms of transcription regulation and cell type identity. The mammalian brain is composed of a huge diversity of cell types with distinct properties and functions. To understand these specific roles, it is necessary to selectively target cell populations for study. However, the need to selectively study restricted cell populations poses a challenge in neurobiology. It is often difficult to collect sufficient cellular input for many standard biochemical and molecular assays. Recently, important advances have been made to scale assays down, opening up new frontiers to explore molecular mechanisms in neurons. Concurrently, methodologies for preparing neurons for such assays has advanced taking into consideration specific methods to preserve the cell biology meant to be assayed. Here we describe a method for preparing live neurons from adult brain tissue for the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC).. Harvest and section brain tissue (1-2 h depending on the number of mice). Micro dissection and tissue digestion (1-1.5 h). Trituration and Percoll separation (1-1.5 h depending on the amount of tissue). Sorting (variable depending on machine and sample size, typically more than 2 h). Preparing nuclei and tagmentation (~1 h). Pause point: Tagmented nuclei can be stored at -20 °C for up to two weeks. Library preparation (2-3 h depending on the number of samples). Pause point: Amplified DNA can be stored at -20 °C. Quality assessment (2-3 h).. The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin coupled with next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming a widely used method to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility (Buenrostro et al., 2013; Corces et al., 2017). A major advantage of ATAC-seq over older methods such as DNase I hypersensitivity mapping, is that it can produce high-quality data from significantly smaller input. This allows chromatin and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to be explored in previously inaccessible populations of rare or sparse cell types. This is particularly useful in the nervous system where cellular diversity is incredibly high and cells of interest are post-mitotic and often sparse. While single cell methods play an important role in identifying heterogeneity and defining certain characteristics of cell types, they are often not suitable for deeper, reproducible characterization, or targeted manipulation and comparison of cell types. The growing number of marker genes and other genetic strategies to label restricted neuronal populations (Shima et al., 2016) is increasing the depth and breadth of molecular and biochemical assays, including ATAC-seq, used to study diverse types of neurons. However, isolation of healthy, high-quality neurons from live tissue requires special considerations. Here we adapt an earlier protocol for isolating neurons from live, adult brain tissue (Hempel et al., 2007) to generate ATAC-seq profiles from sorted populations of 20,000-50,000 cells expressing a fluorescent marker. We successfully used this method to generate ATAC-seq profiles from a diverse range of adult neuronal types (Sugino et al., 2019)."

        "@value": "Murine Liver Myeloid Cell Isolation Protocol. In homeostasis, the liver is critical for the metabolism of nutrients including sugars, lipids, proteins and iron, for the clearance of toxins, and to induce immune tolerance to gut-derived antigens. These functions predispose the liver to infection by blood-borne pathogens, and to a variety of diseases ranging from toxin and medication-induced disorders (CCl4, acetaminophen) to metabolic disorders (steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, biliary obstruction, cholestasis) or autoimmunity. Chronic liver injury often progresses to life threatening fibrosis and can end in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Pellicoro et al., 2014). The liver contains parenchymal cells or hepatocytes that make up the majority of hepatic cells. It also contains non-parenchymal structural cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells and a large number of non-parenchymal innate immune cells, mainly monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, DCs, NK and NKT cells that can trigger an adaptive immune response in the case of infections or other pathogenic insults (Jenne and Kubes, 2013). How this immune response is regulated determines the extent of acute and chronic liver injury (Stijlemans et al., 2014). In this context, liver macrophages have been demonstrated to play central but divergent (from initiating to resolving) functions in liver injury (Sica et al., 2014). It has become clear in the last years that hepatic macrophages consist of two classes, tissue-resident macrophages, the Kupffer cells (KCs) originating from yolk sac/fetal liver progenitors and tissue-infiltrating macrophages originating from bone marrow-derived Ly6CHi monocytes (Jinhoux and Jung, 2014; Tacke and Zimmerman, 2014). Distinguishing the activities of KCs from those of monocyte-derived macrophages during liver injury or repair is currently a frontline research topic in the macrophage field. Indeed, considering that clinical management of liver failure remains problematic, a better understanding of the immune mechanisms regulating liver injury is expected to allow the development of new therapeutic modalities. Here, we describe an isolation technique for liver non-parenchymal polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear myeloid cells permitting their molecular and functional characterization.. Preparation of a liver single cell suspension Sacrifice the mouse using CO2 and restrain it by pinning its paws into a foam surface using syringe needles. Of note, all murine experiments were performed according to the ECPVA guidelines (CETS n° 123) and were approved by the VUB Ethical Committee (Permit Number: 08-220-8). Heparinized blood was taken via cardiac puncture (~1 ml) in order to prevent too much blood contamination when taking the liver. Alternatively, the liver can be perfused in vivo via the portal vein with 10 ml saline. Make a parallel incision from the base of the tail up to the neck along the mouse’s abdomen and to the paws without puncturing the peritoneum. Gently pull back the skin and pin it to the foam surface. Subsequently, open the mouse abdomen and softly move the intestines on the side to get access to the liver using a cotton plug. Gently take out the liver from the body, without damaging it. Store the harvested liver in 5 ml RPMI medium in a 50 ml Falcon tube on ice until the digestion procedure. Put the liver in a GentleMACSTM C-tube and add 5 ml liver digestion medium. Subsequently, cut the liver in small pieces (1-1.5 mm) using scissors (Figure 1A/B). Homogenize the liver using the GentleMACSTM Dissociator (Figure 1C) using 2 times program mLiver_01_03 (16 sec) at room temperature. Subsequently, incubate at 37 °C for 20-30 min while shaking in a water bath to allow digestion of the tissue. Homogenize the liver suspension once more using the GentleMACSTM Dissociator program mLiver_02_03 (25 sec) at room temperature (Figure 1D). Finally, add 5 ml of blocking medium to stop the liver digestion. In order to measure the cytokine content within whole liver, collect 0.5 ml of the solution in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge it at 10,625 x g for 8 min at room temperature. Subsequently, collect the supernatant and store at -20 °C till needed. Filter the remaining liver suspension through a 70-µm sterile nylon gauze into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Wash the GentleMACSTM C-tube with an additional 20 ml of blocking solution and rinse the filter once more with this. Centrifuge the 50 ml tubes at 450 x g for 8 min at 4 °C and gently discard the supernatant. Eliminate the red blood cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 5 ml ice-cold erythrocyte lysis buffer and leaving it on ice for 2-3 min. Neutralize the lysis by adding 25 ml cell suspension medium, and transfer the suspension to a new 50 ml tube through a 70-µm sterile nylon gauze. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube at 450 x g for 8 min at 4 °C and gently discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml cell suspension medium and count the living cells using Trypan blue. At this stage, the suspension contains both parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (including polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs, NK and NKT cells) liver cells. Although this suspension can be analyzed via flow-cytometry, it is advisable to perform additional fractionation steps to allow cell culturing and/or FACS sorting. Fractionation of liver cells using a Lymphoprep gradient separation Add slowly 10 ml LymphoprepTM (Lucron Bioproducts) underneath the resuspended liver cell solution using a 10 ml syringe with long needle. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 25 min at 20 °C without acceleration or brake (Figure 1E). Carefully collect the layer of low-density cells at the interphase containing the non-parenchymal liver cells (enriched in mononuclear myeloid cells as well as T-, B- and NK/NKT-cells). If the interphase is not clearly visible (low amount of cells) you can also collect the upper phase (containing RPMI medium). Take as less as possible of the lower phase containing Lymphoprep (Figure 1E). Transfer the interphase to a new sterile 15 ml tube and fill to the top with MACS buffer. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 7 min at 20 °C and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1-2 ml cell suspension medium, and after counting the cells using Trypan blue, bring at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. After removal of the Lymphoprep, collect the lower fraction (pellet) containing mainly parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells that were not retained within the non-parenchymal cell fraction due to their high density characteristics and transfer it to a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube (Figure 1E). Resuspend the cells in a final volume of 15 ml cell suspension medium and centrifuge at 650 x g for 8 min at 20 °C. Subsequently, in order to remove the Lymphoprep solution perform 1-2 washing steps of 15 ml cell suspension medium. Finally, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml cell suspension medium and, after counting the cells using Trypan blue, bring at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. The interphase (non-parenchymal cells) fraction can now be used for FACS analysis/sorting as well as for cell culturing conditions. The bottom fraction containing hepatocytes and remaining non-parenchymal cells (PMN as well as macrophages with higher density) can also be used for flow-cytometric analysis. The latter fraction can be further cleaned-up using a Percoll gradient in order to separate hepatocytes from the remaining non-parenchymal cells. Of note, if hepatocytes are not needed DNase 1 can be added to the digestion medium, resulting in a cleaner sample. Fractionation of liver cells using a Percoll gradient separation To separate hepatocytes from the PMN and remaining macrophages, mix 1 vol. (~ 5 ml of the 107/ml working solution) of cell suspension with 1 vol. of isotonic Percoll solution of density 1.07 g/ml (33% working solution). Centrifuge for 30 min at 800 x g at room temperature (Figure 1F). Aspirate hepatocytes, forming a broad band at a density of 1.07-1.09 g/ml, from the gradient and wash free of Percoll by two additional cycles of centrifugation at 800 x g, for 5 min and resuspension in 3 ml cell suspension medium. After removal of the Percoll, collect the lower cell pellet fraction containing mainly PMN and macrophages that were not retained within the non-parenchymal fraction due to their density characteristics and transfer it to a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube. Subsequently, centrifuge at 650 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml cell suspension medium, count the cells using Trypan blue and bring them at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. The different fractions obtained in sections B and C can be used for flow-cytometric analysis or when resuspended in complete medium for in vitro cell culturing. Figure 1.

Gradient after centrifugation with a clearly visible interphase (non-parenchymal cells, red arrow) and a pellet (hepatocytes and remaining non-parenchymal cells with higher density). F. Optional: Percoll gradient after centrifugation with a clearly visible upper fraction (hepatocytes, blue arrow) and a pellet (PMN and remaining non-parenchymal cells with higher density). Flow-cytometric analysis Transfer 100 µl of a 107 cells/ml stock solution of the different fractions [(interface Lymphoprep (section B), pellet Percoll (section C)] into a 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube to prevent sticking of cells. Incubate the cell suspension with 1 µg rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 FcR-blocking antibody clone (2.4 G2, 1 µg per 106 cells) on ice water for 20 min. Subsequently, add fluorescently labeled antibodies (0.2 µg per 106 cells) for another 20 min on ice water, protected from exposure to light. Antibodies used are FITC-conjugated Ly6G, PE-conjugated F4/80, APC-conjugated Ly6C, APC-Cy7 conjugated CD45, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD11b and PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated MHC-II. Wash by adding 2 ml ice-cold MACS buffer, centrifuge at 450 x g for 6 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Add 100-200 µl cell suspension medium to keep cells alive, transfer the cells into a FACS tube and proceed to the FACSCantoTM. Analyze the FACS data using FlowJo software. Briefly, after selecting a life gate and single cells (using a FSC-A versus FSC-H profile) select the CD45+ cells in a CD45 versus FSC-A plot (Figure 2, upper and lower panels). Within the CD45+ cells, gate out the PMN based on their CD11bpos Ly6Gpos expression profile and select for the CD11bpos Ly6Gneg expressing cells (Figure 3A). The CD11bneg Ly6Gneg population consists mainly of T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. Next, plot the CD11bpos Ly6Gneg cells in a Ly6C versus MHC-II plot and subsequently check for F4/80 expression. As such, monocytes as Ly6Chigh MHC-IIneg F4/80low cells, monocyte-derived “immature” macrophages as Ly6Chigh MHC-IIhigh F4/80high cells, resident/mature macrophages (i.e. Kupffer cells/”mature” monocyte-derived macrophage) as Ly6Cneg/low MHC-IIhigh F4/80high cells, patrolling monocytes as Ly6Cneg/low MHC-IIneg F4/80low cells and eosinophils based on their Ly6Cint MHC-IIneg F4/80low expression are identified (Figure 3B). Of note, the identity of eosinophils is confirmed based on their SiglecF expression and high SSC. Figure 2. Representative FACS gating strategy for different liver preparations (total liver suspension, Lymphoprep upper fraction, Lymphoprep lower fraction, Percoll lower fraction and Percoll upper fraction). (Upper) Selection of a life gate based on a SSC-A versus FSC-A plot. (Lower) After selection of single cells, select CD45+ cells in a CD45 versus FSC plot. Figure 3. Representative gating strategy for myeloid cells within the CD45+ fraction. A. Plot the CD45+ cells (see Figure 2, lower panels) in a Ly6G versus CD11b plot to identify PMN (CD11bpos Ly6Gpos), mononuclear cells (CD11bpos Ly6Gneg) and CD11bneg Ly6Gneg cells (T-cells, NK-cells, B-cells). B. The remaining CD11bpos Ly6Gneg fraction is plotted in a MHC-II versus Ly6C plot to allow identifying monocytes (Ly6ChighMHC-IIneg), monocyte-derived “immature” macrophages (Ly6Chigh MHC-IIhigh), “resident/mature” macrophages (Kupffer cells, Ly6Cneg/low MHC-IIhigh), patrolling monocytes (Ly6Clow/negMHC-IIneg) and eosinophils (EO, Ly6CintMHC-IIneg). C. F4/80 plot of the inflammatory monocytes (black), patrolling monocytes (blue), Monocyte-derived “immature” macrophages (green) and “resident/mature” macrophages (orange).."

        "@value": "Bacterial Counts in Spleen. Bacterial loads can be determined as colony forming units (CFU) at any point of the infection by culturing spleen homogenates on agar plates. This is a reliable method for comparing the kinetics of infection in various mouse strains, estimating the virulence of different bacterial mutants or isolates and for vaccine testing and vacine estandarization. Although this method has been designed to recover Brucella or Salmonella organisms from spleen, the procedure may be applicable for other bacteria such as Listeria and Mycobacterium as well as to count bacterial loads in other organs such as liver or lymph nodes.. Spleen extraction Latex examination gloves should be used throughout the entire procedure. Mice (Note 1) are infected by the corresponding via (e.g. intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously) using the recommended bacterial dose (e.g. 102, 103, 104) depending on the assay and virulence of the bacteria employed. Intraperitoneal infection is carried out with tuberculin 1 cc syringe, 25-27 g needle and maximum volume of 20 ml/kg. http://www.procedureswithcare.org.uk/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse Weight sterile plastic Whirl-Pak Bags (one per each mouse spleen) to the mg level. Spleen must be obtained immediately after sacrifice (Note 2). Following the corresponding infection period (e.g. 3-15 days), mice are killed by cervical elongation keeping the appropriate ethical protocols and regulations (e.g. cervical dislocation, CO2) (Nagy et al., 2006) (Note 3). After killing, spray the mouse exhaustively with 70% alcohol, and locate on a clean or sterile surface, within a safety vertical laminar flow hood. With small sharp scissors make a small cut into the skin below the belly bottom. Then open the entire abdominal cavity and cut the peritoneum and expose the spleen (situated in the left superior abdominal quadrant of the mouse) or the required organ, following recommended necropsy protocols (Covelli, 2013 http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php) (Note 4) (Figure 1). Figure 1. Spleen extraction indicating: A. position of the mouse for necropsy, B. opening of the mouse skin, C. opening of the abdominal wall and D. spleen extraction (pointed with white arrow). Photographs taken from Covelli, 2013. For details, this work may be consulted at: http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php (date consulted: 09/30/2013). Use small forceps to hold the spleen and then cut the hilum together with the gastrosplenic ligament to remove the spleen and locate inside a pre-weighted sterile plastic Whirl-Pak Bag (Note 5) (Figure 1). Weight the spleens inside the bags using a 4 digit scale balance. To obtain the spleen weight, subtract the value of the empty preweighted plastic bag. Spleen homogenization Add 9 parts of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 per g of spleen (dilution 1:10), assuming that the volume of 1 g of spleen corresponds to 1 ml of PBS (e.g. 0.5 grams of spleen and 4.5 ml of PBS 0.1% Tween 20). Note: Homogenization is easier if a small volume is used at the beginning of the homogenization procedure and then, the remaining volume is completed to reach 1:10 dilution. Spleen homogenization is proficiently carried out by squeezing the organ inside bag by hand. Note: In order to release the intracellular bacteria, spleen cells are disrupted by squeezing the spleen tissue in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After homogenization of the samples, and depending on expected bacterial spleen colonization, decimal (or the required) dilutions are performed with 1x PBS (on 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes or 24 well plates). Note: Open the plastic bag carefully and widely (using steel wires) to avoid contamination of the pipette. For infections using 1 x 106 CFU of bacteria and ranging from 1-30 days, plate 102-105 dilutions. Plating Two plating methods are suggested: Method A Dispense three separate 20 μl drops of each dilution on Tryptone Soya Agar (or the recommended media for growing the tested bacterium) plates using two plates per sample (Figure 2A). Then, let the drops to be absorbed in the agar surface (do not spread out the drops) prior incubation (5-10 minutes). Method B Dispense one 100 μl in each agar plate and distribute the sample with a sterile Drigalski spatula until the inoculum is fully dispersed on the agar surface using two plates per sample (Figure 2B). Notes: Method A is quicker and fewer agar plates are required since four dilutions can be positioned on each plate. In addition, up to three drops can be put for each dilution, lessening counting errors. A minimum of 500 bacteria per g of spleen can be detected if 101dilution is plated. Method B is slower and increases plate consuming but is more sensitive when low bacterial loads are expected. Colony counting is easier since an entire plate is used per dilution. A minimum of 100 bacteria per g of spleen can be detected if 101dilution is plated. Plates are incubated under the required conditions for the bacterial strain (e.g. 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2-3 days) until colony forming units (CFUs) are evident. Count CFU in the various dilutions. Only use the plates (and the corresponding dilutions) in which separate colonies are obtained (10-30 CFUs in Figure 2A or 30-300 CFUs in Figure 2B). Calculate spleen bacterial loads by multiplying CFUs to the corresponding dilution and by 50 in method A or by 10 in method B, respectively. CFUs means can be calculated either by CFUs/spleen (total CFUs recovered) or alternatively by CFUs/gram of spleen (total CFUs recovered divided by total grams of spleen). While the first method does not take into consideration spleen inflammation (size), the second method corrects for spleen swelling. In either case, it is always recommended to plot the spleen weight in a separate graph. Figure 2. Sample plating methods."

        "@value": "BODIPY 493/503 Staining of Neutral Lipid Droplets for Microscopy and Quantification by Flow Cytometry. Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous, dynamic organelles and function as a storage depot for neutral lipids, including triglycerides and cholesterol esters (Walther and Farese, 2012). The movement of lipid species into and out of LDs impacts a variety of cellular processes, such as energy homeostasis, lipid-based signaling, and membrane homeostasis (Greenberg et al., 2011). For example, neutral lipid storage is enhanced upon increased synthesis or uptake of lipid species. On the other hand, extracellular signals can enhance the release of lipid species packaged within neutral LDs. Thus, the investigation of topics involving lipid metabolism may require the assessment of cellular neutral lipid content. In this protocol, we describe the use of the fluorescent neutral lipid dye 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY 493/503) to facilitate quantification of neutral lipid content by flow cytometry and observation of LDs by microscopy.. BODIPY staining for flow cytometry Grow cells under culture conditions relevant for the study. A 35 mm dish/well is sufficient for the cell numbers required in this assay. For our assays, 50,000 A498 cells in 35 mm well were sufficient. Overnight incubation of cells with 30 μM oleic acid can serve as a positive control for increased neutral lipid content, as oleic acid is a potent inducer of triglyceride synthesis and storage. Fatty acid free BSA serves as a control. At the time-point of interest, prepare 2 μM BODIPY staining solution in PBS. The volume of staining solution required for each sample corresponds to the volume of media used for culturing cells. Wash cells with a quick rinse using 3 ml PBS to remove media/serum. Incubate on BODIPY staining solution in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C. Include an unstained control for flow cytometry. Note: From this point, protect samples from light as much as possible. Wash cells with a quick rinse using 3 ml PBS to remove staining solution. Trypsinize cells to generate a single cell suspension. For the A498 cell line used in this protocol, cells were incubated with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 5 min at 37 °C. Add 5 ml of PBS and transfer cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube. Pellet cells at 250 x g, 5 min, 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant, wash the cell pellet with a quick rinse using 3 ml PBS, and pellet cells at 250 x g, 5 min, 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 300 μl 1x flow cytometry buffer. Pass cell suspension through a 35 μm filter into a FACS tube. Perform flow cytometry. Obtain a minimum of 10,000 events per condition. The investigator can analyze data as mean fluorescence (Figure 1A) or display the data as a histogram (Figure 1B). BODIPY staining for microscopy Autoclave coverslips in a glass bottle. In the tissue culture hood, place coverslips into 35 mm cell culture dishes. Prepare 2 mg/ml collagen solution in PBS. Treat the coverslips with collagen to promote cell adherence. Add 3 ml collagen solution to culture dishes and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Note: Use forceps to ensure that coverslips are flush with the bottom of the culture dish, eliminating any air bubbles that may be under the cover slips. Aspirate the collagen solution. Wash with PBS. Add PBS to culture dishes and place under UV light in the culture hood to sterilize. Plate cells into culture dishes containing the coverslips. The optimal cell number should be determined to achieve confluence of 30-50% at the time of staining to permit proper imaging. For A498 cells used in this protocol, 100,000 cells were plated in 35 mm wells to permit staining at 48 h post plating. Incubate under the culture conditions relevant to your experiment. For this protocol, A498 cells were incubated in DMEM (high glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C. Overnight incubation of cells with 30 μM oleic acid with BSA can serve as a positive control for increased neutral lipid content, as oleic acid is a potent inducer of triglyceride synthesis and storage. Fatty acid free BSA serves as a control. At the time-point of interest, prepare 2 μM BODIPY staining solution in PBS. For this protocol, A498 cells were stained 48 h after plating, after an overnight incubation with BSA or BSA + oleic acid. Wash cells with 3 ml PBS. Incubate on 3 ml staining solution for 15 min at 37 °C. Note: From this point, protect samples from light as much as possible. Wash twice in 3 ml PBS. Fix cells in 3 ml 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. Remove 4% PFA. Wash samples 3 x 5 min in PBS. Use forceps to mount cover slips onto glass slides. Add a drop of Prolong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI onto slide. Use forceps to pick up cover slips and place onto the drop of mounting solution, ensuring that the side that side with cells is placed face down onto the mounting solution. Allow the mounting solution to cure overnight at room temperature. Slides can be stored at 4 °C or imaged immediately (Figure 1C). Figure 1. Quantification and visualization of intracellular neutral LDs. A. A498 cells were grown overnight in the presence of BSA (0.2%) or 30 μM oleic acid with BSA. The cells were analyzed according to the section titled “BODIPY staining for flow cytometry”. For each sample, mean FL-1 area was normalized to the mean FL-1 area for the BSA treated samples. Note that oleic acid increased FL-1 area. P-value was determined by an unpaired student’s t-test. ***P < 0.001. B. Representative histograms of cells described in (A). C. A498 cells grown on coverslips were treated overnight with BSA (0.2%) or 30 μM oleic acid with BSA. The cells were analyzed according to the section titled “BODIPY staining for microscopy”.

        "@value": "Clonogenic Assay. Clonogenic assays serve as a useful tool to test whether a given cancer therapy can reduce the clonogenic survival of tumor cells. A colony is defined as a cluster of at least 50 cells that can often only be determined microscopically. A clonogenic assay is the method of choice to determine cell reproductive death after treatment with ionizing radiation, but can also be used to determine the effectiveness of other cytotoxic agents. The following protocol has been modified from a published version (Franken et al., 2006).. Cell preparation: Culture the cells according to the requirement (e.g., GBM cell lines, U87, U251, SF188, etc). Remove medium, and then rinse cells with 10 ml PBS. Add 4 ml 0.25% trypsin to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 1-5 min until the cells appear round. Add 10 ml medium with 10% FBS, and detach the cells by pipetting. Count the cells using a hemocytometer. Note: It is critical to get a relatively accurate number for the cells. Prepare desired seeding concentration, and then seed cell into dishes or 6-well plates. Assay setup: Cell can be plated either before or after the treatment. Plating before treatment: Harvest cells and plate an appropriate number of cells per dish or per well on a 6-well plate, at least in duplicate. The number of cells for seeding should be determined by the aggressiveness of the treatment. Incubate cells for a few hours in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and allow them to attach to the plate/dish. Treat the cells as necessary with chemicals (e.g., 1-100 μM), radiation (e.g., 2-10 Gy) or a combination of both. Incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1-3 weeks until cells in control plates have formed colonies that are of a substantially good size (50 cells per colony is the minimum for scoring). Plating after treatment: Harvest cells after treatment. Fifty or up to 50 x 104 cells can be plated. Prepare serial dilutions with different numbers of cells, should the effects of the treatments be unclear. For radiation treatment, the cells can be plated immediately after treatment or re-plated later. It is always better to keep the cells on ice before re-plating. Incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1-3 weeks until cells in control plates have formed colonies with substantially good size (50 cells per colony is the minimum for scoring). Fixation and staining: Remove medium, and then rinse cells with 10 ml PBS. Remove PBS and add 2-3 ml of fixation solution and leave the dishes/plates at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Remove fixation solution. Add 0.5% crystal violet solution and incubate at RT for 2 h. Add 10 ml medium with 10% FBS, and detach the cells by pipetting. Remove crystal violet carefully and immerse the dishes/plates in tap water to rinse off crystal violet. Air-dry the dishes/plates on a table cloth at RT for up to a few days. Data analysis: Count number of colonies with a stereomicroscope. Calculate plating efficiency (PE) and surviving fraction (SF). PE = no. of colonies formed/ no. of cells seeded x 100% SF = no. of colonies formed after treatment/ no. of cells seeded x PE."

        "@value": "In vitro Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) Tube-formation Assay. Angiogenesis is involved not only in pathological conditions including cancer biology and non-neoplastic diseases, but also many biological processes including reproduction, development and repair. During angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) undergo activation after binding of angiogenic factors to their receptors, release of proteases to dissolve the basement membrane, migration towards an angiogenic signal, proliferation, and an increase in cell number for new blood vessel formation. Finally, reorganization of ECs forms the three-dimensional vasculature. HUVEC tube-formation assay is one of the simple, but well-established in vitro angiogenesis assays based on the ability of ECs to form three-dimensional capillary-like tubular structures, when cultured on a gel of growth factor-reduced basement membrane extracts. During the assay, ECs differentiate, directionally migrate to align, branch, and form the tubular polygonal networks of blood vessels.. Preparation of conditioned medium from target cell line(s) To prepare conditioned medium (CM), seed target cells and grow to 30-40% confluence (depending on the growth rate of the cell lines), replace growth medium with serum-free DMEM (e.g. 10 ml for a T75 tissue culture flask; it does not matter for the presence or absence of antibiotics) for 24 h, then harvest the CM, when cells reach 60-80% confluence in a T75 tissue culture flask. Make 0.5 ml aliquots of the CM and store at -80 °C if it is not immediately used after collection of CM. Preparation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) cells Prepare the HUVEC Medium 200PRF supplement with LSGS according to the product insert. Seed HUVEC cells in T25 or T75 flask, as needed, so that it reaches 70-80% confluence by the next day. Serum starve the HUVEC cells for 3-6 h just prior to performing the tube formation assay in Medium 200PRF without antibiotics (e.g. 5 ml for a T25 tissue culture flask). Note: At the end of serum starvation, go to procedure C step 1. After coating the 96-well plate with growth factor-reduced Matrigel, trypsinize to dislodge the cells from the surface of the flask, neutralize with DMEM with serum, pellet down the cells at room temperature by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm ( 276 x g) for 3 min, resuspend in 2-3 ml serum-free DMEM, determine the concentration of HUVEC by counting the cells, and resuspend HUVEC cells at 4 x 105 per ml serum-free DMEM by pipetting up and down several times to ensure a homogeneous single-cell suspension. Note: For the growth factor-reduced Matrigel, thaw/frozen cycle should be reduced as much as possible. Mix thoroughly while pipetting 500 μl of the HUVEC cell suspension into a 1.5 ml tube. Spin down the cells at 4,000 rpm (1,100 rcf) for 3 min using a bench-top centrifuge. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Remove as much of the supernatant as possible. Prepare the appropriate number of HUVEC cells in 1.5 ml tubes, according to the number of target cell lines to be used. Note: Per target cell line CM, one tube of HUVEC will be suspended, and per suspended HUVEC, 3 triplicate wells will be dispensed. So, in total, 3 wells will be used per target cell line. Thaw a 0.5 ml aliquot of the CM of target cell line(s) collected from procedure A step 2 and supplement it with fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 1% for resuspending the HUVEC cell pellet(s) in procedure B step 5. Note: Each target cell line should be done in triplicate (each well requires 100 μl of the HUVEC cell suspension). Coating of 96-well plate with growth factor-reduced Matrigel Thaw an appropriate volume of growth factor-reduced Matrigel one day before use at 4 °C. Pre-chill the 96-well plate and the pipet tips at -20 °C for 2-3 h. Near the end of serum starvation of HUVEC cells and before counting HUVEC cells, aliquot 50 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel per well of the pre-chilled 96-well plate on ice. Swirl the plate until the gel is evenly distributed over the whole well. It is very important to avoid bubble formation. Allow it to polymerize at room temperature for 1 h on a level surface. Dispensing HUVEC cells in onto coated 96-well plate Dispense 100 μl of the HUVEC cell suspension obtained in procedure B step 6 with thorough mixing into the labeled wells of a 96-well plate. Incubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4-6 h. Visualize the cells using a light microscope. Take pictures of the images of the capillary network and count the tube lengths using the Scion Image software. Figure 1.

        "@value": "Intracerebral Injection of Streptozotocin to Model Alzheimer Disease in Rats. Animal models have promoted meaningful contribution to science including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. Several animal models for AD have been used, most of them related to genetic mutations observed in familial AD. However, sporadic form of AD, also named late-onset is the most frequent form of the disease, which is multifactorial, being influenced by genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Here, we describe a protocol of an AD-like pathology of the sporadic form using Wistar rats by a single bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 2 mg/kg). Icv injection of STZ induces brain resistance to insulin and other pathological alterations related to those observed in AD, such as cognitive impairment and accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein and β-amyloid in the brain. Thus, icv injection of STZ is a useful tool to investigate the pathological mechanisms and the metabolic alterations involved in AD and to propose new therapeutic approaches and neuroprotective drugs.. Surgery setup Sterilize all the surgical tools. Prepare the citrate buffer as described in “Recipes”. In a dedicated surgery room, place all the materials and equipment to be used in the surgery. Measure and take note of the body mass of each rat. In microcentrifuge tubes, individually weigh the amount of STZ needed for each rat based on its body mass. For example, for a 350 g rat, weigh 1.05 mg of STZ which later will be diluted in 6 µl of citrate buffer. Although only a total of 4 µl of this solution will be injected (2 µl per lateral ventricle), which will correspond to a dose of 2 mg/kg, we recommended preparing a larger volume of solution. Note: STZ is health hazard and personal protective equipment is required. The STZ solution has a very short half-life (15-30 min) and is unstable. Solutions should be prepared fresh before use. Cover the microcentrifuge tubes with aluminum foil to protect STZ from light. Number each microcentrifuge tube with STZ with the corresponding rat’s identification number. Keep the microcentrifuge tube with STZ at -20 °C. Prepare the microinjection system. For this, cut the 24 G intravenous catheter using a drill to make a 15 mm longer STZ-injection needle. Connect the STZ-injection needle to the end of the PE-10 tubing (40 cm longer). Fill the PE-10 tubing with water for injection and connect the other end to a 10 µl Microsyringe coupled to an infusion pump. Note: Always make sure the microinjection system is not clogged. Set the infusion pump to run at 1 µl/min rate. Icv injection of STZ (see Figures 2 and 3) Note: Surgery should be performed under sterile conditions. We recommend lubricating the eyes of the rat with saline or eye drops during surgery. Anesthetize the rat with an association of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), both administered intraperitoneally using 25 G needles and 1 ml syringe. Note: It is important to assure that the rat is completely anesthetized and not responsive to a possible painful stimulus. You can check the responsiveness of the rat by pressing the tip of its tail or the sole of its posterior paws. If the rat presents any reaction after 5 min of the injection, the ketamine has to be reinforced up to 50% of the initial dose. Place the rat in the stereotaxic apparatus over the heating pad and maintain rectal temperature around 37 °C. Administer the pentabiotic (48,000 UI, intramuscular) and the ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous), using the 22 G and 25 G needles, respectively, and 1 ml syringe. Shear the dorsal region of the head and clean the area designated for the procedure with the povidone-iodine alcoholic solution. Note: Be very careful not to shave the vibrissae. Using the tissue forceps and the scissors, incise the scalp over the sagittal suture (approximately 2 cm long) and excise the periosteum to expose the skull. Use the Molt elevator to help in this process. Note: Optionally, local anesthetic consisting of 2% lidocaine and epinephrine (1: 200,000) can be injected subcutaneously approximately 1 min before the incision to reduce bleeding. Stereotaxic icv-injections are made with bregma and lambda on the same horizontal plane. For this, check the dorsoventral axis of lambda and bregma. A difference in the lambda and bregma dorsoventral axis under 0.2 mm indicates a correct position of the rat’s head. Drill two small holes in the skull, just large enough to allow the STZ-injection needle to cross through it and penetrate the brain surface, following the coordinates measured from the bregma, to reach the lateral ventricles: -0.8 mm in the anteroposterior axis, ±1.4 mm in the mediolateral axis and -3.6 mm in the dorsoventral axis (Paxinos et al., 2005). Using a micropipette, add the citrate buffer to the STZ previously weighted in a microcentrifuge tube and homogenize it drawing the solution in and dispensing it in the microcentrifuge tube a couple of times. Note: It is expected that the STZ solution presents a slightly yellow color and few bubbles can be observed due to NO release. STZ solutions should be prepared fresh before use. Aspirate 1 µl of air and then aspirate the STZ solution using the STZ-injection needle previously placed in the arm of the stereotaxic device, which is connected to an automated microinjection system. The 1 µl of air is to create a bubble between the STZ solution and the water that is filling the PE-10 tubing. Lower slowly the STZ-injection needle inside the rat brain, passing through one of the skull holes, following the lateral ventricle coordinates. Initiate the icv-STZ injection by activating the infusion pump at a rate of 1 µl/min for 2 min. Thus, 2 µl of STZ solution should be injected in each lateral ventricle. Note: Monitor the flow of the injection through the bubble path along the PE-10 tube. At the end of injection, wait 2 min to withdraw the STZ-injection needle from the lateral ventricle of the brain in order to prevent the reflux of the STZ solution. Repeat the same procedure to the other lateral ventricle of the brain. At the end of STZ injection in both lateral ventricles of the brain, suture the skin. For control rats, inject 2 µl of citrate buffer, instead of the STZ, in each lateral ventricle of the brain, exactly as described in Steps B9-B14. Note: For citrate buffer injection, use a different injection needle and PE-10 tubing from that used for STZ injection. Administer 3 ml of saline subcutaneously to rehydrate the rat. Allow the rat to recovery in an individual cage for at least 3 days. Note: The rat should be under constant observation until its recovery from anesthesia (approximately one hour) and for the following first-week post-surgery. Physiological parameters should be evaluated daily, such as body mass, food, and water intake, as well as behaviors associated with pain and discomfort. If necessary, supplementary feeding, and additional analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antibiotic medication can be administered under the recommendation of the veterinarian in charge. Rats suffering irreversible conditions of pain and weight loss should be euthanized. Icv-STZ injected rats may have more difficult to recover from the surgery compared to control rats. Return the rat to the colony. Figure 2. Setup for the injection procedure. A. Main equipment and tools used for the STZ-injection surgery. B. Microinjection system: infusion pump with a microsyringe connected to one end of a PE-10 tubing. C. Stereotaxic apparatus (lateral view) with the STZ-injection needle connected to another end of the PE-10 tubing, as indicated by arrows. D. Surgical tools and dental drill. Evaluation of the cognitive performance of the rats Note: As AD is characterized in human mainly for their multiple cognitive deficits, to guarantee that the AD animal model mimics most of the aspects of the disease, cognitive testing is essential to detect memory deficits of the animals. For the STZ-model described here, we recommend that behavioral tests be carried out only after surgery full recovery, when animals reach similar body weight values compared to the day before the surgery and present a completely healthy state (approximately one week after surgery). Depending on the cognitive tests used, early deficits can be observed but most of the studies generally perform the behavioral and histopathological analysis one month after surgery, when most of the mimicked aspects of AD can be observed, such as the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein and ventricle enlargement (Knezovic et al., 2015; Moreira-Silva et al., 2018). In this AD model, several types of memory deficits can be evaluated by using the following tasks: the Barnes’ maze, object displacement and the Morris’ water maze for spatial memory; radial and Y-maze for working memory; inhibitory avoidance, escape latency in the elevated plus maze and fear conditioning for emotional memory and new object recognition for recognition memory. The full description of some behavioral tasks can be found in previous studies published by our group (Moreira-Silva et al., 2018, for new object recognition, fear conditioning and escape latency in the elevated plus maze and Motzko-Soares et al., 2018, for Barnes’ and Y-maze). Also, histopathological and molecular analyses of the presence of AD biomarkers induced by icv-STZ injection were described previously by our research group (Moreira-Silva et al., 2018, Motzko-Soares et al., 2018). Figure 3. Schematics of the setup for the injection procedure (A) and top view of the rats’ head in the stereotaxic apparatus (B). In B, the reddish indicates the sheared area in the rats’ head. The two brown points posterior to the bregma indicates the approximate position of the holes drilled for the insertion of the icv injection needle.. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia. One to five percent of AD cases are familial and all the other cases are late-onset also known as sporadic AD. The understanding of sporadic AD has progressed substantially from studies using an AD animal model created by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (Mayer et al., 1990; Lannert and Hoyer, 1998).STZ is a glucosamine-nitrosourea derived from soil microbe Streptomyces achromogenes. The icv injection of STZ impairs cerebral glucose and energy metabolism, which may be a central event for triggering neurodegeneration in AD (Nitsch and Hoyer, 1991; Plaschke and Hoyer, 1993; Duelli et al., 1994). The mechanisms of icv STZ-induced AD-like pathology were recently reviewed by Grieb (2016) and Kamat et al. (2016). The pathological alterations induced by icv injection of STZ are analogous to the features of sporadic AD, which include increase in β-amyloid protein and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in several brain structures, intensive neuronal death, increase of the brain ventricles, cerebral inflammation, cognitive deficit, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, decrease in social interaction, increase of core body temperature and cold-avoidance behavior (Kraska et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Mehla et al., 2013; Knezovic et al., 2015; Dehghan-Shasaltaneh et al., 2016; Crunfli et al., 2018; Moreira-Silva et al., 2018; Motzko-Soares et al., 2018; Vicente et al., 2018; Amani et al., 2019; Crunfli et al., 2019). STZ is usually diluted in saline, citrate buffer, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and administrated in a single or multiple injections in a range of 1-3 mg/kg, unilaterally or bilaterally in the lateral ventricles of the brain (Grunblatt et al., 2007; Kraska et al., 2012; Mehla et al., 2013; Dehghan-Shasaltaneh et al., 2016; Adeli et al., 2017). The pathological alteration induced by STZ are progressive and time- and dose-dependent. Thus, icv-STZ injection is characterized by an acute-fast impairment in the memory, followed by partial recovery, and then, a chronic-slow memory impairment (Knezovic et al., 2015). Also, higher doses of STZ promote more severe and fast neurodegeneration and more evident cognitive deficit (Kraska et al., 2012; Knezovic et al., 2015, Dehghan-Shasaltaneh et al., 2016).Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol used in our laboratory, as summarized in Figure 1. Approximately 30 days from the icv-STZ injection at a dose of 2 mg/kg, clear cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration were observed (Moreira-Silva et al., 2018; Motzko-Soares et al., 2018; Vicente et al., 2018). The protocol used in our laboratory was standardized based on evidences that show: (1) STZ at high doses (≥ 3 mg/kg) promotes alteration on locomotor activity (Dehghan-Shasaltaneh et al., 2016), and also induce acute neurotoxic effect with fast severe neurodegeneration that differs from the slow neurodegenerative progress observed in sporadic AD (Kraska et al., 2012); (2) STZ at lower doses (≤ 1 mg/kg) promotes a very slow neurodegenerative progress and is more appropriate to study neuroprotective drugs (Kraska et al., 2012); (3) an intermediate dose of STZ (around 2 mg/kg) was previously reported as the most efficient dose to modeling a sporadic AD-like pathology (Dehghan-Shasaltaneh et al., 2016); (4) multiple injections of STZ increases animal mortality (Mehla et al., 2013); and (5) STZ shows better stability in solution at pH 4.5 than at neutral pH (Junod et al., 1967). Figure 1. Protocol scheme. STZ (2 mg/kg, 2 µl/ventricle) or vehicle (2 µl/ventricle) is injected in both lateral ventricles of the rat’s brain. In the first week post-surgery, animal recovery should be evaluated. After 30 days of icv-STZ injection, animal behavior and the neurodegenerative alterations induced by icv-STZ can be evaluated."

        "@value": "Senescence Associated β-galactosidase Staining. Detection of senescent cells using a cytochemical assay was first described in 1995 (Dimri et al., 1995). The identification of senescent cells is based on an increased level of lysosomal β-galactosidase activity (Kurz et al., 2000). Cells under normal growth condition produce acid lysosomal β- galactosidase, which is localized in the lysosome. The enzymatic activity can be detected at the optimal pH 4.0, using the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Miller, 1972). In comparison, upon senescence, the lysosomal mass is increased, leading to production of a higher level of β-galactosidase, termed senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) (Kurz et al., 2000). The abundant senescence-associated enzyme is detectable over background despite the less favorable pH conditions (pH 6.0) (Dimri et al., 1995). The SA-β gal positive cells stain blue-green, which can be scored under bright-field microscopy. In this assay it is best to avoid over-confluency of the cells, or cells that have undergone too many passages, as these conditions can cause false positive results.. The manipulation of cells for the SA-β-gal staining assay may be performed in a 24-well plate format. Prepare each sample in triplicate. At 120 h post-transfection or after the cell manipulation, aspirate the cell culture medium and wash the cells with PBS (500 μl per well) twice, using a p1000 pipette. After the last rinse, replace the PBS with 250 μl of 4% PFA for fixation. Incubate the cells for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the 4% PFA and wash the cells two times for 5 min each at room temperature with gentle shaking with 500 μl PBS. Add 250 μl SA-β-gal staining solution to each well. Incubate the cells in the dark in a 37 °C incubator. Terminate the reactions when the cells are stained blue-green, as visualized under an inverted bright-field microscope. To terminate the reaction, aspirate the staining solution and replace with distilled water. Wash the cells a second time in distilled water. After the last wash add 500 μl of distilled water to each well and observe the plate under an inverted bright-field microscope. Capture images of cells in each well using a 10x objective. Images may be printed for counting the total cell number, or count the stained cells on a computer monitor, which may give better distinction between the unstained and stained cells. Represent the SA-β-gal positive cells as a percentage of the total cell number. Note: A trial may need to be carried out to determine the optimal length of incubation with SA-β-gal staining solution for each of the cell lines to be studied. Cells may be observed every 4 h during the first 12 h, and subsequently every 12 h. For example, the optimal incubation period in our hands was determined based on the visibility of the stained cells in test samples (e.g. PAX8siRNA treated samples) but not in the control samples (i.e. untreated sample or/and control siRNA treated sample). It is important to remember that the detection principle of this assay is based on the cellular abundance of the lysosomal β-galactosidase, which varies between cell lines. A table showing the length of optimal incubation time for several cell lines in our hands is as follows (Table 1).."

        "@value": "Isolation, Purification, and Culture of Primary Murine Microglia Cells. The following is a detailed protocol for the isolation, purification and culture of murine brain microglia cells using neutral enzyme digestion and shaking. The protocol below is designed to isolate and culture a large number of purified inactivated microglia cells. Neutral enzyme digestion allows for minimal cellular damage and a higher cell recovery compared to other mechanical dissociative methods such as mincing. Cells cultured using this method will display the size and morphological features of microglia cells.. Stage 1: Isolation and culture of murine microglia cells via enzymatic digestion. Enzymatic disaggregation of mouse brain tissue with trypsin provides a high yield of microglia cells without any detectable cell activations. The base of a 75 cm2 culture flask is coated with 5 ml poly-D-lysine (10 μg/ml) and allowed to set overnight at room temperature (note: Poly-D-lysine assists in the cells adhering to the flask). On the day of the experiment all excess poly-D-lysine is removed as any excess solution is caustic to the microglia cells. The flask is then washed once with PBS. In addition the cleaned culture cabinet/hood is exposed to an additional 30 min of UV light to maximize the sterilization process. Five to eight fetal BALB/c mice (1-3 days old) are culled by cutting both carotid arteries (without decapitating the mouse; otherwise subsequent handling is made difficult) with a pair of scissors and the heads are placed in a beaker with 70% alcohol for 15-30 sec. Step (3) to (g) is represented by Figure 1 (see below). The decapitated heads are removed and all excess blood and alcohol is removed using a piece of sterile gauze. Next the skin over the skull is cleared under aseptic technique. This is achieved by making a crucifix incision over the cranium (transverse incision at the base of the skull and the vertical incision along the midline of the skull up to the anterior part of the skull). A new straight forceps is then used to peel away the skin on the scalp to fully expose the skull. The lambda and sagittal sutures are identified. A pair of corneal scissors are used to cut along the suture lines. A 3rd pair of straight forceps are then used to ‘peel’ the skull away (note: The skull of a mouse this age is very soft and pliable) and to fully expose the brain (note: The following 2 steps must be performed on ice to minimize cell loss). A new curved forceps is then inserted under the base of the brain (taking care not to damage the brain). Gently lift the brain away from the skull base. Place the brain onto a small culture dish that contains a small volume of D-Hanks balanced salt solution. The meningeal lining (dura and arachnoid layers) is then gently removed using two small straight forceps under a magnifying glass. The cleaned brain is then placed in a new culture dish with 2 ml of trypsin / EDTA (0.05%/0.02%). The brain is then minced into a fine slurry using a pair of corneal scissors. The brain / trypsin suspension is transferred gently into a 15 ml centrifuge tube using a 5 ml serological pipette and the same volume of trypsin / EDTA (0.05%/0.02%) is added. The tube is then maintained in the incubator at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 8-10 min to allow for enzymatic disaggregation. After the allocated time, DMEM with 10% FBS is added to the suspension (1:1 ratio) to neutralize the trypsin. The single cell suspension is gently agitated by moving the solution up and down 20 times using a 3.5 ml plastic transfer pipette with care being taken to avoid bubble formation. The suspension is allowed to stand for a minute at room temperature to allow any large pieces to precipitate. This supernatant is passed through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer into another 100 ml beaker. The process of agitation using a 3.5 ml plastic transfer pipette with more DMEM with 10% FBS (equal volume to the supernatant) and straining is repeated twice. All the filtrated fluid is then gently transferred into a 50 ml centrifuge tube using a serological pipette. This is then centrifuged in a cooled (4 °C) centrifuge at 190 x g for 8 min. The supernatant is then discarded and the cell pellet is resuspended in 15 ml of DMEM containing 15% FBS. The resuspended cells are added to the poly-D-lysine coated flask and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 days, the DMEM is replaced with a fresh batch of 15 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. After this, the medium is changed every alternate day using a 1:1 mix of fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and the supernatant of the medium of the flask in order to remove any dead cells and retain existing growth factors previously released by the cells. This is achieved by removing the existing 15 ml via a serological pipette into a 50 ml centrifuge tube period followed by an immediate replacement with 7.5 ml of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS. The ‘old’ medium is then centrifuged to remove dead cells at 190 x g. To make the 15 ml required for the flask, 7.5 ml of the centrifuged supernatant is added. This process can be repeated for up to 10-14 days. When the cells are approximately 80-90% confluent, they can be used for purification. Stage 2: Purification of murine microglia cells from the mixed glia cell culture Once the mixed glia cell culture achieves a 90% confluence level (after 10-14 days) the microglia cells can be detached from the flask using the heated orbital shaker/belly dancer machine at 240 rpm for 1.5 - 2 h (37 °C). Twenty-hour hours prior to disaggregation, the medium is replaced with fresh DMEM containing 15% FBS. The next day the flask is placed on the heated orbital shaker at 200-240 rpm/min at 37 °C for 2 h. The suspension is transferred into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then centrifuged at 190 x g for 8 min. The supernatant is discarded and the cell pellet is resuspended in fresh DMEM containing 15% FBS. The cells are then seeded onto a 24-well tissue culture plate that has been pre-coated with 5 ml of poly-D-lysine (10 μg/ml). The cells are distributed into 7.5 x 104 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium is replaced every 2-3 days with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell growth is observed regularly using a microscope (Figure 2). The cellular yield is 1 x 106 microglia / mouse. The original mixed glia cell flask is replenished with 10 ml fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. After this, the medium is changed every 2-3 days using a 1:1 mix of fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and the supernatant of the medium of the flask as described above. The purification process described above can then be repeated a week later. After plating the cells in the 24-well plate, the cells must be used within a week (optimal for the first 3 days). The cell purity can be assessed via flow cytometry using the anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody. Figure 1. Method for the removal of the brain from a 1-3 day old mouse Figure 2.

        "@value": "Axon-seq for in Depth Analysis of the RNA Content of Neuronal Processes. Neuronal processes have an RNA composition that is distinct from the cell body. Therefore, to fully understand neuronal biology in health and disease we need to study both somas, dendrites and axons. Here we describe a detailed protocol of a newly refined method, Axon-seq, for RNA sequencing of axons (and dendrites) grown in isolation using single microfluidic devices. We also detail how to generate motor neurons from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells for sequencing, but Axon-seq is applicable to any neuronal cell. In Axon-seq, the axons are recruited through a growth factor gradient, lysed and directly processed to cDNA without RNA isolation. A careful bioinformatic step ensures that any soma-contaminated samples are easily identified and removed.. Storage and washing of microfluidic devices Commercial microfluidic devices from Xona MicrofluidicsTM (Standard Neuron Devices) with any groove length can be stored in dH2O and used multiple times. Note: The groove length of the devices could affect the proportion of axons versus dendrites that can cross over to the opposite chamber, as could the length of time of culture in the devices. For mouse motor neurons, we used devices with 150 μm length grooves and saw a clear majority of axons being recruited during the 7 days of culture. For human motor axons, we used devices with 450 μm grooves. Place devices in a glass beaker with 500 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in dH2O for 2 h and use a magnetic stirrer to keep devices agitated. Use a soft brush to gently clean the microgroove surfaces and the chambers of the devices. Transfer devices into dH2O afterward. Wash 3 x 10 min in fresh dH2O each time to remove any residues of Triton X-100. Then, sterilize devices in 70% ethanol for a minimum of 10 min. Note: The washing procedures can be done at any time and devices can be stored in 70% ethanol to be ready when needed. Start the device attachment (below) the day that the coating procedure is to be initiated. Attachment of microfluidic devices to cell culture surface Remove microfluidic devices from 70% ethanol using sterile forceps and allow the devices to air-dry in a sterile laminar flow hood for 20 min. Use a suction aspirator to remove any residual ethanol. Note: It is very important that devices are entirely dry at this stage, as any remaining liquid will negatively affect device attachment and can cause leakage in later stages. Place 4 drops of 4 μl dH2O in a sterile 10 cm bacterial dish (Figure 1A). Place sterile glass cover glasses (32 x 24 mm, thickness #1 or #1.5) on top of the water drops to ensure that the cover glasses do not move around within the dish (Figure 1B). Use forceps to pick up one device at a time and gently press it, feature side down, onto the glass coverslip (Figure 1C). Apply gentle force, using the back of the forceps, to the center of the device (above the grooves), and all four corners. A microscope can be used to assess if all the grooves are in the same focal plane and thus attached to the coverslip. Devices attached in this way are stable for at least four weeks (and likely longer). Label the glass coverslips with a waterproof marker in one corner to define the future left-right orientation of the devices. The device forms the ‘ceiling’ for the cells and creates grooves for the axons to grow through. Cells will attach to the glass surface of the coverslip. Notes: The final setup of devices (Step B4) is a suggestion. Devices can also be placed directly in tissue culture-grade plastic dishes (i.e., directly onto the plastic, without cover glasses). For imaging purposes, however, placing them on glass coverslips is beneficial. In addition to the PDMS devices described here, Xona MicrofluidicsTM also offers pre-bonded devices for cell culture use (XonaChips). While these cost the same as regular devices, they are not optimal for reusing, as can be done with the regular devices (SND150). In the case of pre-bonded devices, the attachment step (Procedure B) can be skipped. Figure 1. Setup of 4 microfluidic devices in a 10 cm dish. A. First, place 4 drops of 4 μl dH2O spaced apart evenly in the 10 cm dish. Then place glass cover glasses onto the drops to create a water seal between cover glasses and the plastic dish. B. When cover glasses are attached, place one microfluidic device with feature-side down on each cover glass. Press gently on the top of the device to ensure attachment. C. Final setup of four devices in one 10 cm dish. Other arrangements of devices (in terms of dish size) can be made if desired. Coating of surfaces in microfluidic devices Day 1: The primary surface coating consists of 0.001% poly-L-ornithine in dH2O. Prepare 0.5 ml solution per device. Add 75 μl solution into the two bottom wells of each device. Typically, the liquid will quickly fill the chambers through capillary forces. If this does not happen, use the aspirator with a mounted 1 ml pipette tip to gently suck the liquid through from the top. Do not aspirate all the liquid. Once the liquid has flown through, add 150 μl to the top left and 200 μl to the top right compartment. Adding different volumes between the left and right chamber ensures that the coating is forced into the microgrooves over time. Leave the coating on overnight at room temperature and shield it from light (e.g., a drawer works well). Day 2: Wash the devices twice using 1x PBS. To wash, aspirate the coating from the wells, then add PBS into the wells, 75 μl in the bottom, then 150 μl in the top. The second coating consists of a solution of 2 μg/ml fibronectin and 5 μg/ml laminin in PBS. Add this last coating in a similar fashion to the first–see Steps C2-C4. Specification of motor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells Typically, a good starting point for differentiation is a 10 cm dish of stem cells at ~70-80% confluency. Cells are always maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Day 1: Prewarm TrypLE Express to be used for dissociation at 37 °C (i.e., 2 ml for a 6 cm dish, 4 ml for 10 cm dish) in a tube. In addition, pre-warm a tube with 8 ml DMEM/F12-GlutaMAX (or any other plain MEM-based media). Add the TrypLE Express to initiate the dissociation. When cells have rounded up and are coming off the culture dish, use a pipette to dissociate them fully in the TrypLE Express, then transfer everything into the tube with pre-warmed DMEM. Spin down for 4 min at 200 x g, at room temperature. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml of mouse MN media (Recipe 1) and count. Place cells in bacterial (non-adherent) dishes at a density of 0.5-1.5 million cells per ml (the number of cells is line dependent and needs to be tested out), and place dishes on a low-speed orbital shaker at 30 rpm overnight in the incubator. Day 2: Remove dishes from the shaker and change to fresh mouse MN media. To change media on EBs, pipette the entire volume of media (including EBs) into a tube. Allow the EBs to sink for ~2 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend EBs in 1 ml fresh media and place into a new culture dish. Days 3-6: Change to fresh mouse MN media, supplemented with 100 nM all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and 500 nM smoothened agonist (SAG). Repeat for 4 successive days. See Table 1. Table 1. Factors for motor neuron differentiation from mouse pluripotent stem cells Day 7: After 4 consecutive days of patterning, cells are ready to be dissociated and seeded into microfluidic devices (see below). Specification of motor neurons from human pluripotent stem cells Typically, a good starting point for differentiation is a 10 cm dish of stem cells at ~70-80% confluency. Cells are always maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Day 1: The procedures on the first day (EB formation) are the same as described above for mouse ES cells. However, in the end, resuspend the cells in human EB media at a density of 0.5 M-0.75 M cells per ml (this density may require a degree of optimization between cell lines). Supplement the Day 1 human EB media with the required factors for Day 1 (for overview, see Table 2): 5 μM Y-27632 (ROCK-inhibitor) 200 nM LDN-193189 40 μM SB-431542 3 μM CHIR-99021 200 μM ascorbic acid Table 2. Factors for motor neuron differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells Days 2-10: Perform daily media changes at approximate 24 h intervals with the corresponding factors for each day (Table 2). Note: During the RA-SAG stage of the protocol (days 3-10), it is not absolutely required that media changes follow 24 h intervals, and if necessary (but not recommended) one day of media changes can be omitted. However, it is critical that the dual-SMAD inhibition (using SB-431542 and LDN-193189) during the first two days is 48 h and not shorter. Day 10: Cells are ready to be dissociated and seeded into microfluidic devices (see below). Cell dissociation and preparation for seeding Transfer EBs into a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube. Allow the EBs to sink to the bottom for 1-5 min and aspirate the remaining media. Add 1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) TrypLE Express to the Falcon tube with EBs. The dissociation takes 10-20 min, depending on the size of the EBs. Gently agitate the EBs every 5 min by tapping the tube or gently pipetting up and down using a 1 ml pipette. Note: If you resuspend EBs by pipette for the first time after 5 min in TrypLE Express, do not pipette them up into the pipette tip as they tend to stick on the inside. Instead, just pipette the liquid and ensure the EBs consequently are agitated slightly in the suspension. Once the EBs are beginning to break apart, pipette them up and down rather vigorously approximately 10 times to finalize the dissociation. Add 9 ml of pre-warmed DMEM to dilute the 1 ml of TrypLE Express. Filter the resulting suspension through a 70 μm cell-strainer filter to remove undissociated clumps/debris, then spin at 200 x g for 4 min, at room temperature. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of DMEM/F12-GlutaMAX (or any other plain MEM-based media). Count the cells. Adjust the density to a final concentration of 2.5 x 104 cells per μl (this will ensure that a total of 1 x 105 cells are seeded per microfluidic device later on). To do this, transfer 1 ml of the cell suspension into an Eppendorf tube and spin once more at 200 x g for 4 min. Resuspend cells in the required amount of media (i.e., 1 μl for every 2.5 x 104 cells). At this stage, the cells should be resuspended in the final culturing media, for human cells this is B27 media with the Day 10 factors (see Table 2), for mouse cells this is mouse MN media with Day 7 factors (see Table 1). Note: The exact composition of the final media can vary based on the type of neurons in culture. However, the addition of ascorbic acid and trophic factors (and ROCK-inhibitor for human cells) is highly recommended to improve survival upon plating in the confined environment of the microfluidic device. Prepare sufficient final media to fill all devices (0.5 ml per device). In the end, the device will hold media volumes as shown in Figure 2. Take the required amount of media (see Figure 2) for the axonal compartment (top and bottom well) and transfer to a new tube. Add trophic factors to increase the concentration to 50 ng/ml. The higher concentration of trophic factors on the “axonal” side will improve axonal recruitment across the microgrooves. Figure 2. Media volumes and trophic factor concentrations in the microfluidic device at seeding. Note that somatic concentrations of the neurotrophic factors differ between human and mouse MNs. After axons have crossed the microgrooves into the other compartment, trophic factor concentrations can be equalized to 10 ng/ml on both sides, both for mouse and human. Cell seeding Start removing coating from the devices by aspiration (from one 10 cm dish with four devices at a time). Add 4 μl of the axonal media (containing 50 ng/ml BDNF/GDNF) into the chamber on the axonal side. Pipette close to the chamber entrance on the top-left (in the orientation of Figure 2, see Figure 3A for photograph) and allow capillary forces to pull the liquid into the chamber. Add the cells in the same manner to the other compartment. Once cells are seeded in the chamber, place devices in the incubator and allow the cells to attach for approximately 15-20 min. Start checking devices from 10 min after seeding the cells and onward to avoid excessive evaporation of the media. Once cells appear attached, add the final media amounts to the wells as indicated in Figure 2. Check if the cells remain attached and then place devices in the incubator overnight. Notes: Occasionally cells do not attach well even after 15 min, maybe in part due to the flow between the compartments. If this occurs, we recommend adding only 40 μl of media to all wells (keeping the right media types for each side), which will avoid excessive flow between compartments. This way, there is minimal flow and evaporation will not be an issue. Then keep the cells like this for an additional hour and finally add media to the recommended amounts in Figure 2. For human cells, the dissociation takes place on Day 10 of the protocol. In addition to everything described here, maintain the corresponding factors in the media for each day as described in Table 2. The trophic factor (BDNF/GDNF) concentrations described there are for the somatic compartment, the axonal compartments receive the trophic factor gradient for the first few days (see below). Figure 3. Seeding cells into microfluidic chambers and representative micrographs. A. Example photographs of the angle at which media/cells can be added into the chambers of the microfluidic device. Dashed lines show the location of the chambers, and chamber entrances. B. Micrographs of a good culture in the axonal compartment and the somatic compartment, where clusters of neuron somas are visible. Culturing devices After seeding neurons into microfluidic devices, change media daily to ensure that the trophic factor gradient stays intact. A bright field microscope can be used to keep track of the axonal growth. Note: When changing media, do NOT aspirate media out of the chambers as this will forcibly remove all cells/axons, only change media in the wells. Once axons can be seen crossing several microgrooves into the axonal compartment (i.e. > 10 grooves with axons), the trophic factor gradient can be removed, and both compartments instead receive 10 ng/ml of GDNF and BDNF. At this point, media can be exchanged every other day. See Figure 3B for a successful micrograph of a microfluidic device with growing axons. Compartmental harvesting for RNA sequencing Prepare the lysis/harvesting solution. Prepare ~70 μl solution per microfluidic device, or less if only one compartment is harvested (final recommended lysis volumes are 50 μl for the somatic compartment and 10 μl for the axonal compartment). The lower volume for axons ensures that a higher concentration of RNA is present in the final solution, which aids in downstream applications. The lysis solution (see Recipes) is made up as a 2% Triton X-100 solution in nuclease-free dH2O. First, cool this solution on ice, then supplement with: 0.5 μl RNase-inhibitor per 100 μl (final concentration of 0.2 U/μl) 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), required for RNase-inhibitor enzymatic activity Note: Always keep lysis solution on ice during preparation and use. Prepare nuclease-free Eppendorf tubes. Label them according to the samples that are being collected, and pre-cool them on ice. Have dry ice ready to snap-freeze harvested samples immediately following the collection. Optionally, before starting the harvesting, take bright field images along the grooves. If somatic contamination is detected in the downstream bioinformatics analysis of axon samples, these images can be scrutinized for evidence of any cross-contaminating somas. Harvest one device at a time. Begin by washing both compartments once with pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS. Use at least 100 μl PBS. Remove PBS from the axonal wells and add 10 μl lysis solution to the top of the chamber, as if seeding cells (the vastly higher volume of PBS on the somatic side prohibits any lysis solution from flowing through the grooves and accidentally lyse somas). Wait for 10 s, then pipette up and down ~5 x in the bottom well, and extract as much solution as possible from the bottom of the chamber (can be > 10 μl). Transfer solution into a prepared Eppendorf tube and snap-freeze on dry ice. Add at least 100 μl PBS to the axonal side again. Repeat Steps I7 and I8 above for the somatic side, but instead use 50 μl lysis solution. When extracting the solution, try to extract as much as possible (> 50 μl). Snap-freeze on dry ice. After collection and snap-freezing, samples for RNA sequencing can be stored at -80 °C until further used. Note: For detailed instructions, protocols and reagents for the preparation of RNA sequencing libraries without RNA-extraction, see Nichterwitz et al., 2018. To generate axonal and somatodendritic sequencing libraries, standard laboratory practices related to handling of RNA must be considered. Namely, keep the samples cold (4 °C) and surfaces clean. Work with RNAse/DNAse-free disposables and reagents certified for molecular biology grade. Consider establishing a dedicated working station (bench) and a thermocycler exclusive for library preparation purposes. Due to the low amount of material (RNA) per device, comparable to that of single cells, we employed the Smart-seq2 protocol, an established methodology for single-cell transcriptomics. Briefly, in the first step, samples are quickly thawed from -80 °C and 10 μl of axonal lysate (5 μl of somatodendritic lysate) are subjected to reverse transcription using an oligo-dT primer and a template switch LNA-oligo. In the second step, an enrichment PCR with 18 cycles is introduced to amplify the amount of cDNA and samples purified using magnetic beads. At this point, the quality and quantity of the cDNA libraries can be measured by bioanalyzer using a dsDNA high sensitivity chip (for representative examples, see Figure 4). Finally, cDNA libraries are tagmented (Nextera XT Kit, Illumina) and barcoded with Illumina indexes for RNA sequencing. Figure 4. Typical bioanalyzer profiles for RNA sequencing using Axon-seq. Axonal cDNA samples have a distinct profile compared to somatodendritic samples. An example of ready to sequence axonal sequencing library is also shown after tagmentation reaction and barcoding. Fixation of cells in devices for staining purposes Remove all media from the wells and wash both compartments once with PBS. Add a solution of 4% formaldehyde in PBS. When adding the formaldehyde, maintain similar volumes in all wells as used during media changes (see Figure 2) to ensure a flow both through the compartments and across the microgrooves. Leave the devices to fix at room temperature for 30 min. Wash 3 times with PBS, dispose of formaldehyde waste. Store devices in PBS (~200 μl in all wells) until further use. If not used within a few days, wrap the 10 cm dish with parafilm. Note: Either before or after performing the desired staining method (immunocytochemistry/FISH/RNAscope), devices need to be removed along with coverslips from the 10 cm plastic dish. Using a 1 ml pipette, add a thin line of H2O around the edges of the cover glass. This will loosen it from the underlying surface and cause it to float after a few seconds/minutes.. Neurons are highly polarized cells. Their processes, both dendrites and axons, need to be able to respond to changes in the microenvironment in a manner independent of the soma (Holt and Schuman, 2013). To fully understand neuron biology, it is therefore important to be able to study neurites in isolation, in addition to conducting analysis of the cell bodies. This appears particularly important for neurons where the axon and dendrites constitute the majority of the cellular volume, as is the case for spinal motor neurons where we estimate that they comprise approximately 99% of the cellular volume. To isolate neurites, there are excellent tools such as Campenot Chambers (Boyden, 1962; Campenot, 1977) or microfluidic chambers (Taylor et al., 2005).However, while neurites are separated out in such devices, it is important to bear in mind that cross-contamination between compartments can still occur. Thus, RNA sequencing of isolated axonal compartments (Minis et al., 2014; Saal et al., 2014; Briese et al., 2016; Rotem et al., 2017) can lead to incorrect results/conclusions when the purity and exclusion of somas is insufficiently examined. To ensure detailed and accurate investigation of motor axonal mRNA composition and its modulation in ALS we developed Axon-seq (Nijssen et al., 2018). This is an application of our LCM-seq method for single-cell spatial RNA-sequencing (Nichterwitz et al., 2016).In Axon-seq, we use microfluidic devices to separate axons from stem cell-derived motor neurons (mouse and human) from their somas. As motor neurons have axons that traverse far longer distances than their dendrites, we are able to analyze axons alone. This may not be possible for all neuronal subtypes, but the method still allows for analysis of neurites as an entity. In contrast to previous methods, Axon-seq does not require an RNA isolation step, and it allows for high sensitivity and cost-efficient sequencing from a single microfluidic device.Notably, Axon-seq effectively eliminates all samples with any somatic cross-contamination, as it uses a highly stringent and sensitive bioinformatic quality control step that identifies axonal samples containing trace levels of mRNA from undesired cell somas. Here we provide a detailed protocol for Axon-seq which can be applied to any cell containing longer processes."

        "@value": "Sulforhodamine B (SRB) Assay in Cell Culture to Investigate Cell Proliferation. The SRB assay has been used since its development in 1990 (Skehan et al., 1990) to inexpensively conduct various screening assays to investigate cytotoxicity in cell based studies (Vichai and Kirtikara, 2006). This method relies on the property of SRB, which binds stoichiometrically to proteins under mild acidic conditions and then can be extracted using basic conditions; thus, the amount of bound dye can be used as a proxy for cell mass, which can then be extrapolated to measure cell proliferation.The protocol can be divided into four main steps: preparation of treatment, incubation of cells with treatment of choice, cell fixation and SRB staining, and absorbance measurement. This assay is limited to manual or semiautomatic screening, and can be used in an efficient and sensitive manner to test chemotherapeutic drugs or small molecules in adherent cells. It also has applications in evaluating the effects of gene expression modulation (knockdown, gene expression upregulation), as well as to study the effects of miRNA replacement on cell proliferation (Kasinski et al., 2015).. Treatment solution preparation Volumes of treatment of choice should be enough for triplicates in 96-well plates (50 μl per replicate; final volume in well 100 μl) or six replicates in 384-well plates (10 μl per replicate; final volume in well 20 μl) and also account for pipetting variation. Treatment can be prepared in aqueous solution (Opti-MEM for transfections) or solvent of choice (e.g., DMSO). Cell preparation Remove medium from cell monolayers and wash the cells once with sterilized PBS. Remove PBS and add 1 ml (100 mm plates) 0.25% (wt/vol) trypsin to evenly cover the cell-growth surface. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min or until cells start to dissociate. Next inactivate trypsin with 10 volumes of culture medium containing FBS, and mix up and down to obtain a homogeneous single cell suspension. Transfer the cell suspension to a sterile Falcon tube. Determine the cell concentration by counting in a hematocytometer chamber under a microscope using a 1:1 mixture of cell suspension and 0.4% (wt/vol) trypan blue solution to determine cell viability prior cell seeding. Optional: before counting, spin down cells in order to wash trypsin and resuspend in growth medium. Note: Only proceed to next steps if cells in solution look healthy by checking trypan blue staining (Figure1). Figure 1. Trypan blue staining of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). The arrow points to a colored cell indicating that the cell is dead. The live cell underneath it, has an intact membrane and thus is not colored. Adjust the cell concentration with growth medium (10% FBS) to obtain an appropriate cell seeding density per well in a volume of 50 μl (96-well format) or 10 μl (384-well format). Note: Initial cell seeding density will depend on two main factors: 1) doubling time of the cell line used and 2) the day the plate will be read. Cells are typically at 70-80% confluency (2 x 104 for 96-well format and 8 x 103 for 384-well format) by the end of the experiment (day 5). Transfer the cell suspension into a sterile reagent reservoir to make it easier to pipette with a multichannel pipette. Treatment exposure Mix the treatment solutions prepared in step A by pipetting. Dispense 50 μl (96-well format) or 10 μl (384-well format) of solution into each well. Mix cell suspension prepared in step B thoroughly and add 50 μl (96-well format) or 10 μl (384-well format) to each well already containing treatment solutions. Note: Ensure even cell distribution in the bottom of the plate and avoid shaking the plate to avoid 'ring effects'. The best way to achieve this is to add the cell solution directly to the bottom of the well, avoiding touching the walls. We also recommend performing a short spin of the plate (20 sec, 10 x g) before placing it in the incubator. Set aside three wells in the plate containing only Opti-MEM or solvent of choice and cell suspension for an untreated or vehicle control. Also, leave three wells in the plate containing only medium for background subtraction. Incubate the plate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until plate is to be read. Note: The incubation time will depend on the type of compound being tested and has to be experimentally determined. For example, in our hands we observe the biggest difference in cell proliferation between negative control and a tumor suppressive miRNA 5 days following transfection. Cell fixation and staining Gently add 25 μl (96-well format) or 5 μl (384-well format) cold 50% (wt/vol) TCA to each well directly to medium supernatant, and incubate the plates at 4 °C for 1 h. Mixing is not required, as this could lead to some cells detaching from the bottom of the well. Wash the plates four times by submerging the plate in a tub with slow-running tap water and remove excess water by gently tapping the plate into a paper towel. After the last wash allow the plate to air-dry at room temperature. Note: Cell monolayer detachment can occur if water is forced into the wells. We recommend letting the plate dry completely before continuing to next step. If necessary, dried plates can be stored at room temperature indefinitely. Add 50 μl (96-well format) or 20 μl (384-well format) of 0.04% (wt/vol) SRB solution to each well. Note: Ensure that the solution is in direct contact with the bottom of the well and that there are no bubbles in between. SRB solution is not light sensitive thus plate does not need to be covered during incubation. Leave at room temperature for 1 h and then quickly rinse the plates four times with 1% (vol/vol) acetic acid (200 μl for 96-well format or 30 μl for 384-well format) to remove unbound dye. Allow the plate to air-dry at room temperature. Note: Non-homogeneous washes are a major source of error in this assay. Washes must be done quickly and homogeneously across the entire plate. This is particularly important for 384-well format. The small area of the wells leads to high superficial tension sometimes making it difficult to wash the plates uniformly. Visually check that all the wells in the plate have been injected with 1% (vol/vol) acetic acid and that there are no bubbles preventing the washes. We recommend washing with multi-channel pipet and injecting the solution indirectly into the wells using the walls of the wells. Absorbance measurement Add 50 μl to 100 μl of 10 mM Tris base solution (pH 10.5) to each well and shake the plate on an orbital shaker for 10 min to solubilize the protein-bound dye (approximately 10 min). Measure the absorbance at 510 nm in a microplate reader.. The SRB assay has been widely used to investigate cytotoxicity in cell based studies and it is the method of choice for high cost-effective screenings (Vichai and Kirtikara, 2006). Since this method does not rely on measuring metabolic activity [e.g., 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT], the steps required to optimize the protocol for a specific cell line are substantially simplified. The protocol described here has been optimized for medium throughput screening of miRNAs with tumor suppressive properties in adherent lung cancer cells in 96-well format and 384-well format (Kasinski et al., 2015). Particularly the SRB assay in 384-well format offers the advantage of screening a large number of miRNA mimics or compounds in a single plate (> 60 per plate, 6 replicates) using inexpensive equipment and reagents."

        "@value": "3D Organoid Formation from the Murine Salivary Gland Cell Line SIMS. Salivary glands consist of multiple phenotypically and functionally unique cell populations, such as the acinar, ductal, and myoepithelial cells that help produce, modify, and secrete saliva (Lombaert et al., 2011). Identification of mechanisms and factors that regulate these populations has been of key interest, as salivary gland-related diseases have detrimental effects on these cell populations. A variety of approaches have been used to understand the roles different signaling mechanisms and transcription factors play in regulating salivary gland development and homeostasis. Differentiation assays have been performed with primary salivary cells in the past (Maimets et al., 2016), however this approach may sometimes be limiting due to tissue availability, labor intensity of processing the tissue samples, and/or inability to long-term passage the cells. Here we describe in detail a 3D differentiation assay to analyze the differentiation potential of a salivary gland cell line, SIMS, which was immortalized from an adult mouse submandibular salivary gland (Laoide et al., 1996). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found in vivo to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure et al., 2015; Song et al. 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells in vivo, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific in vitro controlled conditions.. SIMS subculture Pre-warm cell medium, 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free or 1x HBSS- Ca+2-Mg+2 free and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in a water bath at 37 °C. Aspirate off old medium with vacuum aspirator or use 10 ml pipettes to manually aspirate from the T75 cell culture flask. Wash twice with 10 ml of sterile 1x PBS/HBSS-Ca+2-Mg+, aspirate off completely-either manually with a 2 ml pipette or with an aspirator and sterile fresh 2 ml glass pipette. Add 3 ml of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA per T75 flask. Incubate plate with cells at 37 °C for 5-7 min. Tap and gently shake the plate to dislodge cells. Neutralize trypsin by adding fresh ~3-5 ml culture medium using a 10 ml pipette. Pipette gently up and down several times to re-suspend cells and transfer to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 100 x g for 3 min, wash 2 times with 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free, and take up the cells in desired amount of culture medium. Plate up to 1 million cells to get 95% confluency in 4-5 days in a T75 tissue culture flask. Note: Cell viability (~90-95%) is determined by trypan blue cell count. Organoid differentiation culture Resuspend SIMS cells in SIMS medium at 0.4 x 106 cells/ml. Thaw out growth factor reduced matrigel matrix on ice for 10 min before culturing cells. Both collagen and matrigel need to remain on ice until they are resuspended with cells for plating. Add 50 μl of cell solution (10,000 cells) to 100 µl of 60:40 ratio of Type I rat tail collagen to growth factor reduced Matrigel on ice. Mix gently while slowly pipetting up and down using a 200 μl pipette. Notes: Aliquot collagen first then Matrigel. Do not mix with pipette until you add cells to avoid bubbles. Avoid fast aspiration or suspension of aliquoted matrix mix to avoid bubble formation. Deposit cell/collagen/matrigel mix in the center of 24-well tissue culture plate on ice and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C. Add up to 1 ml differentiation medium. Change medium every 2-3 days. Cultures are maintained up to 14 days as the cells reach maximum confluency within the matrix, and the matrix starts breaking down. Organoid formation can be seen starting Day 5 of culture (Figure 1). Figure 1. Collagen-matrigel embedded SIMS cells expand and form organoids by Day 5 (A) and 7 (B). Scale bars, 200 μm (4x magnification). Organoid fixation Wash matrix with ice cold 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free gently up to 3 times. Cells can be fixed at any timepoint using 2% PFA in 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free for 20 min on ice or at 4 °C. Rinse the matrix with ice cold 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free 3 times. Incubate matrix in 1x PBS-Ca+2-Mg+2 free for 10 min. Repeat this 3 times for a total of 30 minutes. Using forceps, gently remove the matrix from the tissue culture plate. Note: You can cut the matrix into 2-3 pieces using a fine blade if you want multiple cryo blocks. Embed with OCT (a full description of embedding can be found in Campbell et al., 2011). Note: Matrix will likely curl up in OCT if it is poured too quickly. Gently pour, and fix any curling using your forceps. Optimal cutting thickness is between 12 and 16 μm. Sections can be post fixed with 4% PFA, ice cold acetone, or acetone/methanol for staining optimization. 3D matrix staining To conserve the 3D morphology, staining is performed on 1 mm3 pieces of the organoids embedded in matrix. Post fixation, small pieces of matrix including organoids are cut using a sharp scalpel blade and pointed tweezers. Treat each chunk separately in a plastic dish or 24-well plate. Matrix can be treated again with 2-4% PFA, acetone/methanol, or methanol treatments if necessary. Matrix is treated like tissue slides for staining. An example is described in Athwal et al., 2019. Mount each sample on glass slides with 1-2 spacers depending on the size of the matrix. Capture images using a confocal microscope (Figure 2). This staining can also be performed on cryosections of OCT embedded organoid matrix (Athwal et al., 2019). A complete description of the primary and secondary antibodies used in Figure 2 can be found in above-mentioned manuscript. Figure 2. 1 mm3 collagen/matrigel matrix with 3D grown SIMS organoids were stained with E-cadherin post-fixation with 4% PFA. Scale bar, 10 μm.. In vitro differentiation assays are a remarkable tool that enables us to analyze the potency of cells without relying on in vivo models. Cells in these assays can be manipulated for gene expression to, for instance, analyze their differentiation ability. While previous protocols have described the differentiation potential of primary salivary gland cells in vitro, our protocol is optimized for the use of the SIMS cell line (Laoide et al., 1996; Maimets et al., 2016). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found in vivo to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure et al., 2015; Song et al. 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells in vivo, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific in vitro controlled conditions. Our recent work shows that SIMS cells have the ability to differentiate into unique populations of acinar, myoepithelial, and duct cells in 3D differentiation conditions, that normally produce, modify and secrete saliva in vivo (Lombaert et al., 2011; Athwal et al., 2019). This protocol describes the workflow necessary for the generation and analysis of 3D differentiated SIMS cells. SIMS cells are cultured in a 3D matrigel/collagen matrix over a period of 7-9 days. Matrigel is a solubilized basement membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, which is rich in several growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin-1, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans (Patel et al., 2016). Matrigel has been shown to induce differentiation of stem/progenitor cells and outgrowth of already differentiated cell types by causing polarization of cells embedded in or on top of it. For SIMS grown in this 3D matrix, organoid formation post single cell culture is apparent around day 5 of culture. These organoids are also stained either via cryosectioning or in 3D to analyze for differentiation markers and cell populations. Alterations, such as cell transfections, transductions and/or media changes, to this condition can easily be made to address specific research questions (Athwal et al., 2019). The media components were adjusted using literature from both existing salivary and mammary gland differentiation protocols, which deemed necessary to induce differentiation of the SIMS cells in vitro. Here we show the robust use of this cell line to address specific research questions without having to rely on primary salivary gland cells."

        "@value": "Isolation and Imaging of His- and RFP-tagged Amyloid-like Proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans by TEM and SIM. In our recently published paper, we highlight that during normal aging of C. elegans age-dependent aggregates of proteins form and lead to functional decline of tissues. The protocol described here details the isolation of two proteins from C. elegans in their aggregated amyloid-like form, casein kinase I isoform alpha (KIN-19) and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA (RHO-1). We used nickel beads to isolate His-tagged KIN-19 and RHO-1, and thus permitting the isolation of both small and large aggregated or fibrillary forms of the proteins. We characterized their morphology by transmission electron microscopy. We further expressed RFP-tagged proteins and stained them with a fluorescent molecule, thioflavin T, which identifies β-sheet structures, and which is a defining feature of amyloid fibrils. We further applied structured illumination microscopy to determine the level of colocalization between RFP and thioflavin T.. Lysis of C. elegans Defrost pellets of C. elegans expressing KIN-19::Hisavi and expressing RHO-1::Hisavi, these should ideally have been frozen in PBS with protease inhibitors (one protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml of PBS, PBS is made with 1 tablet in 100 ml H2O). To reduce C. elegans protein adherence to the microcentrifuge tubes, all tubes used in the experiments need to be incubated with 10% BSA in PBS for 10 min to coat the tubes. Using a pipette with the end cut off giving a wide pore to allow easy mixing of the suspension, resuspend the worm pellet mixture in a 1:1 ratio with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with protease inhibitor tablets to a volume of 250 μl. In a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube sonicate the suspension at an amplitude of 10 microns for 10 s on, 30 s off, 10 s on, on ice or in a cold room and further homogenise it manually with a plastic pestle for 10 strokes. Centrifuge the tubes for 1 min at 800 x g at 4 °C. The pellet contains the unwanted cuticle fragments and unlysed worms, carefully remove the supernatant. Then further centrifuge the supernatant at 21,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Carefully transfer the supernatant and resuspend the remaining pellet in 250 μl of PBS with protease inhibitors. Push and pull the resuspended pellet through a 30 G needle three times. Isolation of aggregated RHO-1 and KIN-19 by nickel beads By cutting the end of a HisTrap FF Crude column remove 20 µl of precharged Nickel Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads and incubate them with the resuspended pellet overnight at 4 °C on a fixed speed rotator at 20 rpm. Note: Any nickel bead will likely work. The next day centrifuge the tubes at 800 x g for 1 min remove the supernatant (containing unbound proteins) to leave the His-tagged proteins, fibrils and beads. To remove the His-tagged aggregates and fibrils from the beads add 60 µl of 500 mM imidazole in PBS pH 8.0 (adjust pH with HCl) and incubate overnight at 4 °C on a fixed speed rotator at 20 rpm. To isolate eluted aggregates and fibrils, centrifuge the beads at 800 x g for 1 min and collect the supernatant containing the aggregates and fibrils which are then used for imaging experiments. Note: We tried shorter times for His-tagged protein/fibril adherence to the beads and for elution, but this was not as successful as the overnight incubations. Unsuccessful elution protocol: incubate precharged Nickel Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads with resuspended worm pellets for 15 min on a vortex mixer (Stuart, SA8) at 400 rpm. Then centrifuge the beads to pellet them at 800 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant. Add 60 µl of 500 mM imidazole in PBS pH 8 (adjust pH with HCl) to the beads and incubated for 3 min on a vortex mixer at 400 rpm, but this was not long enough to successfully remove fibrils, shown by Western Blot and TEM in Figures 1A and 1B. Confirming protein capture and release with nickel beads by Western blot We tested the capture of protein aggregates and fibrils to the nickel beads and their successful elution by Western blot. Incubate 5 µl of crude worm pellet + 5 µl PBS, 3 µl of nickel beads after incubation + 7 µl PBS, 10 µl of supernatant after incubation and 10 µl of eluted aggregates with 4x LDS buffer at 100 °C in a heat block for 5 min. Use 10 µl of the sample to separate by 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel and then transfer to a PVDF membrane for Western blotting. Block the membrane with 5% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 min to reduce background signal. Incubate the membrane with anti-6xHis tag primary antibody at 1:1000 with PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 on a roller for 1 h. Then wash the membrane three times in PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 for 5 min each time. Incubate the secondary antibody, anti-mouse-HRP, with the membrane at 1:1000 with PBS and 0.05% Tween-20 on a roller for 1 h. Wash the membrane five times in PBS and 0.05% Tween-20. Incubate the membrane with Supersignal West PicoPLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate for 5 min before imaging using the G:Box Chemi imager (Figure 1A). Figure 1. Representative Western blot and TEM images of successful and unsuccessful binding and elution of aggregated His-tagged proteins to nickel beads. A. Western blot using an α-6xHis primary antibody to show representative successful (lanes under blue line) elution of His-tagged RHO-1 and unsuccessful (lanes under black line) elution of KIN-19 from nickel beads. The α-6xHis has identified 6xHis-tagged RHO-1 and KIN-19 of varying sizes indicating the presence of aggregates as well as degraded protein. Negative-stain transmission electron micrographs showing (B) unsuccessful elution of KIN-19::His protein from nickel beads and (C) successful capture and elution of RHO-1::His (RHO-1 fibrils indicated by a blue arrow) and (D) KIN-19::His (KIN-19 fibrils indicated by a blue arrow). Grids are negatively stained using 2% uranyl acetate. Scale bar = 100 nm. Imaging isolated protein aggregates by TEM Glow discharge the carbon coated copper grids using argon gas on a Quorum Technology K100X at 25mAmps for 2 min. Add 10 µl of protein sample to the grid and incubated for 1 min. Wash the grid twice for 5 min in dH2O by making a 200 μl droplet of dH2O and placing the grid in the droplet. Incubate the grid once in 10 μl 2% uranyl acetate for negative staining for 30 s before drying it by blotting with filter paper. A Tecnai G2 80-200kv TEM at the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre was used for imaging the grids (Figures 1B-1D). The Tecnai imaging software allows you to do point-to-point measurements of fibril widths and lengths, the diameters of the RHO-1 and KIN-19 fibrils were ~15-20 nm. Point-to-point measurements can be used to determine periodicity/helicality of fibrils, although periodicity was not observed in the RHO-1 or KIN-19 fibrils. Note: We attempted to immunolabel the fibrils with the anti-6x His tag primary antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to 10 nm gold beads, but the fibrils had been washed off the grids at the end of the staining process. It might be useful to not glow discharge the grids to keep it hydrophobic, allowing the fibrils to adhere better. Preparation of C. elegans protein extracts for imaging by SIM We initially tried to image RHO-1::His aggregates that were fluorescently labelled with antibodies, using the Anti-6x His tag primary antibody and the Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate secondary antibody, but the extensive washing involved in antibody staining meant many aggregates were washed off the chamber slides and very few remained for imaging (Figure 2A). To obtain more aggregates and fibrils for fluorescence imaging, we instead used RHO-1::tagRFP worms which were already fluorescently labeled, and control worms which did not contain any amyloid aggregates as confirmed by the absence of ThT staining, fem-1(-). Process the worms as per Protocol A, Lysis of C.elegans, and use the crude worm pellet for imaging using SIM. Coat Nunc Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide wells with 0.1% poly-L-Lysine for 30 min at RT before incubating 200 μl of the resuspended crude worm pellets in the wells along with 50 µM of ThT in PBS for 1 h at RT, keep the chamber slide under foil to keep in the dark (ThT powder added to PBS and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter). Remove the non-adhered pellet by pipetting and wash three times with 200 μl PBS by pipette before imaging (Figure 2B). Note: The ThT stock solution must be within its recommended usage period and freshly prepared for optimal binding and fluorescence. Figure 2. SIM imaging to confirm the presence of RHO-1 positive amyloid structures. Extracts from C. elegans worms were stained for amyloid structures using ThT and examined for colocalization with RHO-1. A. SIM showed colocalization of ThT positive structures and His-tag immunostained RHO-1 proteins. B. We also observed colocalization of ThT positive structures with RHO-1::RFP and observed both fibrillar and inclusion body-like structures. Scale bar: 1 μm. Imaging protein aggregates by SIM To visualize amyloids from worm extracts, we used our custom-built SIM providing a spatial resolution approaching 90 nm at frame rates reaching 22 Hz3. Objective-60x water. Exposure time: 25 ms for each channel. Wavelengths used: 561 channel for RFP-Rho1 488 channel for ThT 647 channel for immuno-labeling with secondary antibody conjugated to AF647 dye. Hardware control and image reconstruction were performed with software written in LabView and Matlab (Ströhl and Kaminski., 2015). For visualization, Fiji was used.. During aging, there is often a dysregulation in protein homeostasis and therefore an accumulation of damaged or non-functional proteins. Protein damage can occur by reactive oxygen species or post-translational modifications, along with mutations and transcriptional changes that naturally occur with age. One of the most studied forms of protein malfunction during aging are protein aggregates referred to as amyloids. These amyloids are found in many age-associated diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Soluble monomeric protein converts into an insoluble state where structure alters and proteins aggregate to form β-sheet rich fibrils. It is not clear whether the body is sequestering damaged or misfolded proteins into these amyloid fibrils when protein homeostasis is dysregulated or whether the formation of amyloid fibrils further dysregulates protein homeostasis, or both. Screening for proteins most likely to become insoluble upon aging Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) yielded two target proteins, casein kinase I isoform alpha (KIN-19) and Ras-like GTP-binding protein rhoA (RHO-1) (David et al., 2010). These two proteins were further studied to investigate their aggregation propensity during the ageing of C. elegans, whether they formed amyloid-like structures and whether they correlated with a functional decline (Huang et al., 2019). In this protocol we first express the amyloid-like proteins KIN-19 and RHO-1 with a 6xHis-tag, this permits us to isolate the proteins with nickel beads. There can often be fibrous structures within small organisms such as C. elegans, but isolating His-tagged proteins ascertains that we isolate the protein of interest. Use of nickel beads rather than a nickel chromatography column allowed us to isolate large structures such as fibrils and aggregates which can get stuck in nickel columns. Subsequent imaging of eluted His-tagged proteins on a transmission electron microscope (TEM) permitted us to investigate the morphology of potential amyloid fibrils due to the sub-nanometer resolution provided by the TEM. However, a defining feature of amyloid fibrils is the presence of highly structured β-sheets which cannot be determined using TEM. Thus, in order to determine the presence of β-sheet structures in our proteins of interest we used structure illumination microscopy (SIM) which has ~200 nm resolution. We expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged proteins in C. elegans and concomitantly stained them with thioflavin-T (ThT), a molecule which fluoresces when it intercalates into β-sheet structures. We then consequently investigated the colocalization of RFP and ThT fluorescence."

        "@value": "Non-invasive Quantification of Cell Wall Porosity by Fluorescence Quenching Microscopy. All bacteria, fungi and plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall. This complex network of polysaccharides and glycoproteins provides mechanical support, defines cell shape, controls cell growth and influences the exchange of substances between the cell and its surroundings. Despite its name, the cell wall is a flexible, dynamic structure. However, due to the lack of non-invasive methods to probe the structure, relatively little is known about the synthesis and dynamic remodeling of cell walls. Here, we describe a non-invasive method that quantifies a key physiological parameter of cell walls, the porosity, i.e., the size of spaces between cell wall components. This method measures the porosity-dependent decrease of the plasma membrane-localized fluorescent dye FM4-64 in the presence of the extracellular quencher Trypan blue. This method is applied to bacteria, fungi and plant cell walls to detect dynamic changes of porosity in response to environmental cues.. Yeast sample Culture yeast cells in 5 ml YPD medium (see Recipes) in round bottom tubes in a shaker incubator at 30 °C for 24 h or according to the requirements of a specific strain or a specific experiment. Transfer 500 μl of the culture into a centrifuge tube, centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml PBS (pH 7.2-7.4, see Recipes), centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 50 μl PBS-based FM4-64 solution (50 μM) and incubate for 3 min at room temperature in the dark. Note: Keep FM4-64 solution in the dark and stock solution on ice. Samples that have been labeled with FM4-64 should be imaged within 10 min, as the dye will eventually be endocytosed. Endocytosis of FM4-64 is indicated by internal signal, typically occuring in the form of small spheres. Add 1 ml PBS solution and centrifuge for 1 min at 4,000 x g, discard the supernatant. Repeat this step one time. Transfer 2 μl stained cells onto a microscope slide and add 10 μl PBS, mix by stirring with the pipet tip and place a coverslip. Note: If there are issues with cell movement during imaging, yeast cells can be immobilized on slides coated with polylysine or an agarose pad. Mount the slide on the microscope and locate cells using bright field mode with a 100x objective. Note: Especially with samples of microorganisms, it is important to minimize exposure to laser light, which will cause bleaching. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust focus in bright field mode before switching to confocal mode and immediately acquire an image. Switch to confocal acquisition with 488 nm or 514 nm laser and a 582/75 nm bandpass emission filter to detect FM4-64 emission (see Notes). Pinhole diameter should be below two airy discs (about 100 μm). Set imaging parameters (laser power, detector gain or exposure time) to get a bright signal without overexposure. Acquire images. Typically, one image of 3-6 different areas per sample can be taken. Prepare additional samples following Steps A2 to A8, but instead of adding PBS to the slide in Step A6, add PBS-based Trypan blue solution, each time with a different concentration (1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μM). Acquire images of each sample without changing any imaging parameters. Arabidopsis thaliana seedling root sample Grow Arabidopsis seedlings in half-strength MS medium on plates (see Recipes) at 22 °C with 16 h light/8 h dark for 7 d (Figure 1). Put a whole seedling into a tube containing 20 μM PBS-based FM4-64 solution, incubate for 3 min and wash with PBS solution in a staining jar. Add 50 μl PBS onto a microscope slide, arrange the seedling on the slide and add cover slip onto the root part of the seedling (Figure 1). Find the target region, for example the elongation zone, using a 40x objective and bright filed mode. Switch to confocal acquisition with 488 nm or 514 nm laser and a 582/75 nm bandpass emission filter to detect FM4-64 emission (see Notes). Pinhole diameter should be below two airy discs (about 100 μm). Set imaging parameters (laser power, detector gain or exposure time) to give a bright signal without overexposure. Acquire images. Typically, one image of 1-3 different areas per sample can be taken. Prepare additional samples following Steps B2 to B5, but instead of adding PBS to the slide in Step B3, add PBS-based Trypan blue solution, each time with a different concentration (1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μM). Acquire images of each sample without changing any imaging parameters. Figure 1. Preparation of Arabidopsis root samples. A. Seven-day-old seedlings grown on plates. B. Seedling with root submerged in FM4-64 solution. C. Seedling washed in PBS buffer in a staining jar. D. Seedling mounted on a slide with root covered by the cover slip. Maize leaf sample. Bacterial, fungal and plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall which has a multitude of different functions, including, defining size and shape, and controlling the exchange of substances within the environment. A key feature of cell walls is their flexibility. Long polysaccharides form a strong network and their structure is frequently adjusted, for example to allow for cell elongation, or to counter pathogen attack. In addition, cell wall porosity allows for molecular movement between the wall’s various components. Cell wall porosity is also a reliable indicator of digestibility and saccharification efficiency of cell wall material (Himmel et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2012; Tavares et al., 2015) and has been linked to anti-fungal drug uptake (Liu et al., 2019). Current methods for measuring cell wall porosity are based on relatively invasive methods, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Sugimoto et al., 2000; Xiao et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017), which alter the original cell wall structure and may lead to artifacts. Another method, cryo-FESEM, is less invasive but the resolution is limited to 20 nm (Derksen et al., 2011). Pore size distributions at sub-nanometer resolution can be obtained by gas adsorption, but this method also requires harsh sample pretreatment (Adani et al., 2011). Instead of determining pore sizes directly, other methods measure the capacity for molecular movement within the wall, which can be compatible with live-cell analysis. For example, the relative porosity of yeast cell walls assesses the measuring the effect of different-sized polycations on the leakage of UV-absorbing intracellular compounds (De Nobel et al., 1990). Similarly, the effect of fluorescent quenchers with different hydrodynamic radius on the autofluorescence of lignin can be measured to gain insight on differences in porosity between wood samples (Donaldson et al., 2015). The method presented here makes use of the ability of quenchers to diffuse through the cell wall to determine relative porosity. In contrast to the approaches described above, this method works on living cells and can be applied to all accessible tissues and all organisms. It measures the fluorescence intensity of the dye FM4-64 located at the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular quenchers. The quenching effect has been shown to depend on cell wall porosity (Liu et al., 2019). The method has been successfully used on bacteria, fungi and plants, for example to determine changes in wall porosity during drought-induced cell elongation in the model plant Arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2019).The method described below uses Trypan blue as a quencher. In comparison with other quenchers, Trypan blue has a higher dynamic range (Liu et al., 2019), which results in more reliable results when analyzing cell walls with low porosity. Furthermore, Trypan blue is widely available, doesn’t require co-factors and is inexpensive. The protocol for yeast cells can be quickly adapted to any other microorganism, by choosing the right culture medium and growth conditions. Similarly, the protocols for Arabidopsis roots and Maize leaf samples can be adapted to other plant species. For root samples, however, growth on agar plates is recommended instead of cultivation on soil, because it can be difficult to clean all soil particles without damaging the root surface."

        "@value": "Preparation of Parasite Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis. In order to prepare protein extracts of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages for western blot analysis, infected red blood cells (iRBC) need to be separated from uninfected red blood cells (uRBC) which make up the bulk of the parasite culture. Depending on the localisation of the parasite protein of interest, different methods are available to achieve this. If the protein is present within the parasite or is attached to a cellular structure of the iRBC cell, saponin can be used. This reagent lyses the membranes of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, the Maurer´s clefts (vesicular structures in the iRBC) and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane containing the parasite but leaves the parasite plasma membrane intact, providing a convenient procedure to isolate intact parasites without uRBCs. However, this method has the disadvantage that the host cell cytosol and the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) content of iRBCs are lost. If this has to be avoided, it is possible to use a Percoll gradient to separate intact iRBCs from uRBCs. Sequential treatment with Tetanolysin and saponin can then be used to selectively release the iRBC cytosol and the PV content from the parasite. These selective lysis methods are also suitable to determine the subcellular localisation of a protein of interest.. Parasite protein extraction Saponin lysis to remove the soluble PV content, the host cell cytosol and uRBC. Centrifuge 10 ml of a Plasmodium falciparum culture (5-10% parasitemia) at 500 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml 1x PBS. Centrifuge again, resuspend the pellet in 4 ml saponin lysis buffer (0.03%) and incubate on ice for 5-20 min. Centrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 5 min to pellet the parasites and repeatedly wash the pellet with 1x PBS until the supernatant shows no red colour anymore. Note: Usually 3 washing steps are necessary. Discard the supernatant and add 2-8 µl 25x protease inhibitor cocktail. Depending on the size of the parasite pellet, resuspend the pellet in 50-200 µl parasite lysis buffer. Note: In general 100 µl parasite lysis buffer will work for 10 ml of a parasite culture >5% parasitemia but this depends on the proportion of schizont stage parasites as these stages contain a lot of DNA. Addition of DNase can be used to reduce the viscosity of the extract. The extracts can be stored at -20 °C if not used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Percoll gradient to obtain intact iRBC followed by saponin lysis to separate soluble host cell and PV content from parasite material. Centrifuge 10 ml of a Plasmodium falciparum culture (5-10% parasitemia) at 500 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml 1x PBS. Centrifuge again and remove the supernatant. Prepare the percoll gradient by adding first 500 µl 80% percoll solution to a 2 ml tube, then carefully layering 500 µl 60% percoll solution on top of the 80% percoll and finally layering 500 µl 40% percoll solution on top of the 60% percoll (Figure 1, Percoll gradient). Note: Use the gradient immediately. Resuspend the pellet with 200 µl 1x PBS and slowly pipette the parasite solution on top of the gradient. Centrifuge immediately at 16,000 x g for 5 min. Note: Touch the side of the tube with the pipette tip while adding the parasites to avoid mixing of the solutions. Carefully collect the desired parasite stage band into a new 1.5 ml tube (see Figure 1 for selection of correct phase from the gradient) and add 1 ml 1x PBS. Note: If too much percoll solution is transferred, for instance if no clear iRBC phase was apparent (Figure 1A, scenario 3), the parasites may not pellet properly after the first washing step. In this case only remove the top region after centrifugation of the first wash, and replace again with 1x PBS to bring down the overall percoll concentration of the solution. The iRBCs should then pellet after in the next centrifugation step. Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min and wash the parasite pellet at least 3x with 1 ml 1x PBS. Note: Use a fresh tube for each washing step. Resuspend the pellet in 50 µl PBS, then add 50 µl saponin lysis buffer (0.03%) and incubate on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 5 min. Transfer the saponin supernatant into a fresh tube (final extract of host cell cytosol and PV content) and add 4 µl 25x protease inhibitor cocktail. The extract can be stored at -20 °C if not used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Wash the pellet with 1x PBS until the supernatant is clear. Note: In general 3 washing steps are necessary. Add 4 µl 25x protease inhibitor cocktail to the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 100 µl parasite lysis buffer. The extract can be stored at -20 °C if not used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Figure 1. Percoll gradient and outcomes. A. Preparation/Set-up of a Percoll gradient without and with parasite culture (top left). Three possible results after centrifugation are shown under 'outcomes' (top right): 1) one band consisting of mostly debris, merozoites and segmented schizonts at the border between the 40% Percoll and the aqueous region (present above the 40% percoll after centrifugation) and one band above uRBC/ring stage region consisting of younger schizonts and trophozoites (This is the fraction to harvest.); 2) similar appearance to 1) but with multiple bands below the debris/merozoites/segmented schizonts phase; these bands usually consist of different stages of iRBCs and can all be collected; 3) no clearly defined band; in this case collect the indicated fraction (from the mid 40% to the region just above the uRBCs and ring stage phase, making sure not to disturb this phase). Although in this case the stages may be too distributed to be seen as a clear band in the gradient, this usually will still result in a good recovery once pelleted and washed. B. Example of a purification of iRBCs infected with PF13_0191-GFP parasites. GFP, PF13_0191-GFP fluorescence; DIC, differential interference contrast; merge, both images merged. Percoll gradient and sequential treatment with tetanolysin and saponin to obtain extracts of the host cell cytosol and the PV content, respectively. Perform steps A2a-e. Resuspend the parasite pellet in 99 µl 1x PBS and add 1 µl tetanolysin (1 µg/ml). Mix the solution immediately by flipping the tube with your finger. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Note: The tetanolysin activity may vary with batch and depending on the number of freeze thaw cycles of the aliquot used. If standardised results are needed, activity testing with uRBCs can be conducted before each use. For this incubate serial dilutions of tetanolysin with 20 µl of 70% haematocrit RBCs for 1 min at 37 °C followed immediately by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 3 min to assess lysis (pellet of uRBCs left). For the percoll pellet use 10x the amount of tetanolysin required to just lyse all of the 20 µl uRBCs. Note that the actual number of parasites obtained after percoll purification also influences lysis efficiency. Centrifuge the lysate at 16,000 x g for 5 min. Transfer the tetanolysin supernatant into a fresh tube (final extract of host cell cytosol) and add 4 µl 25x protease inhibitor cocktail. The extract can be stored at -20 °C if not used immediately for SDS-PAGE. Wash the pellet with 1x PBS until the supernatant is clear. Resuspend the pellet in 50 µl 1x PBS, add 50 µl saponin lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min. Perform steps A2g-i. SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis of parasite protein extracts SDS-page Prepare a polyacrylamide gel with a 5% stacking and a 12% separating gel, 0.75 mm thickness. Centrifuge the (thawed) parasite protein extract at 16,000 x g for 5 min and transfer the supernatant into a fresh tube. Add the required amount of 5x SDS sample buffer and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min. Note: Some multi-transmembrane proteins can aggregate if heated, warming the extract to 50 °C may then be applied. Load the prestained protein ladder (4 µl) and 8 µl of the extract into the slots of the gel in the electrophoresis chamber filled with electrophoresis buffer and run the gel at 200 V for 1 h. Western blot analysis Soak a nitrocellulose membrane and 6 sheets of chromatography paper cut to the size of the gel in 10 mM CAPS (pH 11.2). Prepare the blot in the following order: anode (+), sponge, 3 sheets of chromatography paper, the nitrocellulose membrane, the SDS gel, 3 sheets of chromatography paper, sponge, cathode (-). Perform protein transfer in a tank blot device at 15 V per gel and 4 °C over night. Dismantle the blot-sandwich and immediately transfer membrane to 1x PBS for a brief rinse. Note: Gel can be stained with Coomassie to check efficient transfer. Incubate the membrane with 10 ml blocking solution in a 50 ml falcon tube at room temperature for 1 h on a rolling device. Replace blocking solution with 5 ml of fresh blocking solution. Add 5 µl primary antibody (e.g. mouse anti-GFP 1:1,000) to the blocking solution and incubate the membrane at room temperature for 3 h on a rolling device. Wash the membrane 5x with 10-20 ml 1x PBS at room temperature for 5 min on a rolling device. Dilute 1.7 µl secondary antibody (e.g. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 1:3,000) in 5 ml blocking solution and incubate the membrane at room temperature for 1 h on a rolling device. Wash the membrane 5x with 10-20 ml 1x PBS at room temperature for 5 min on a rolling device. Incubate the membrane with enough ECL solution to cover the blot (1.5-3 ml) at room temperature for 5 min on a rolling device. Transfer the membrane between 2 layers of transparent sheets. Apply X-ray films for different times in the dark. Develop the X-ray films in the developer.."

        "@value": "Hippocampal Neuron Dissociation Transfection and Culture in Microfluidics Chambers. Microfluidics chamber is an ideal tool to study local events that occurring in neuronal projections by perfectly compartmentalizing the cell soma from certain branches. It is very well suited for live cell imaging or immunohistochemistry staining. This protocol has been carefully modified in detail to fit the requirement of primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. It can also be applied to a more general neuronal culture purpose in microfluidics.. Coverslip and Chamber Preparation Day 1: PDMS devices are fabricated as described in Park et al. (2006). Day 2: Corning No.1, or No.1.5 coverglasses are both suitable for our microscope (24 mm x 40 mm). Or, Carolina coverglasses 24 mm x 50 mm. Sonicate the cover glasses in autoclaved ddH2O for 60 min. Sonicate again in 70% EtOH for 30 min. Sonicate in 100% EtOH for 30 min. Wash with autoclaved ddH2O in TC hood, air dry the coverglasses overnight in the hood. Day 3: Assemble the coverglass and PDMS device by using the plasma-bonding machine. Press firmly on the corners but only lightly touch the middle channel. Coat the chamber with PDL (>150K mol wt, prepared in borax boric acid buffer): 0.5 mg/ml PDL is added to a well on one side of the device and allowed to flow through into the connecting well (leave the other side unfilled). Allow the PDL to flow through the device for about 10 min and then add more PDL to the wells to fill them up. Place the devices containing PDL in an incubator at 37 °C for a minimum of 30 min to let the PDL fill the micro-groves. Fill the wells and major channel on the other side of the chamber with PDL and return the chamber to incubator at 37 °C for a minimum of 4 h, overnight is preferable. Day 4: Pipette out the excess PDL after treatment, but be careful not to suck all the liquid out of the device. Add autoclaved ddH2O to each well on either side of the device, and allow to flow to the other well by capillary action. Aspirate off the water (again being careful not to fully remove all the liquid from the device), then add another 150 μl of autoclaved ddH2O to one of each connected well and allow it to flow through to the corresponding well. Repeat this quick wash twice, then place the device containing ddH2O in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, repeat the wash step again. Wash the devices at least three times with ddH2O for one hour each, which is the total. Add NBM with the necessary factors (glutamax, B27, PenStrep) to the top wells. Let it flow through, incubate at 37 °C overnight. Prepare 40 ml plating media: 800 μl B27 + 30 μg/ml gentamicin + 400 μl glutamax + 25 μM glutamate Prewarm 10 ml dissociation media in 15ml tube: Neurobasal + 5% FBS + gentamicin. Prewarm 10 ml plain neurobasal media for papain. Day 5: Add laminin (20 μg/ml) to each well and incubate at 37 °C for at least 30 min: Coat the chamber with laminin: take a 20 μl aliquot out from -80 °C freezer and put it on ice immediately, wait until it dissolves completely on ice then add cold neurobasal media to 1.8 ml. Turn the UV light on and UV sterilize one 6 cm cell culture dishs for 15 min. Pre-warm 14 ml plating media in this 6 cm cell culture dish, 37 °C incubator. Replace the laminin solution with plating media 1 h before plating the cells. Dissection of hippocampal neurons Activate papain 10 mg aliquot with 750 μl papain buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Add to prewarmed neurobasal media, filter sterialize, then add one DNase 20 μl aliquot. Wash the tissue with 10 ml cold dissection media in TC hood (wash twice). After the tissue settled by gravity, remove HBSS completely. Add one aliquot of DNase to 10 ml digestion media (prewarmed yesterday). Place half of digestion media (5 ml) onto the tissue for 15 min at 37 °C water bath. Add the remaining half of digestion media into the tube and incubate for another 15 min at 37 °C water bath. Let the tissue settle to bottom by gravity or spin shortly. Re-suspend the pellet with 5 ml papain dissociation media and triturate up and down with 5 ml pipette for 5 times, avoid bubbling the media. Let debris settle slowly, or short spin to 100 g up and down (600 rpm), transfer the supernatant to a new 15 ml tube. Continue triturate the undissociated tissues for 5-10 times, take the supernatant and combine with previous 5 ml. Take 10 μl out and mix with 10 μl trypan blue. Load 10 μl mixture on hemacytometer and count: All cells in 16 small squares x 104 = cells/ml (A typical yield from 12 E18 pups is ~50 M in total). Amaxa transfection Mix 82 μl nucleofector solution with 18 μl supplement before use. Prepare 50 μl nucleofector with 5 μg total DNA (if using more than 1 plasmid, mix in equimolar ratios). Spin down 5 million (1-6 million for each transfection) neurons at 150 x g 5 min. During spinning, transfer 7 ml pre-warmed plating media to a 15 ml tube, add 350 μl FBS, keep at 37 °C. Prepare the 1 ml pipette with a tip. After spinning, remove all media using aspiration pipette with a 200 μl pipette tip. Resuspend the cells in a 50 μl nucleofector solution. Mix 50 μl of the cells with the premix of DNA + neucleofector (a total of 100 μl). Zap with program G-13 (better for Hc) or O-03 (better for Cx). A foam of dead cells will form. Immediately pipette in 1 ml warmed plating medium with FBS and pipette out to a 1.7 ml eppendorf tube. Do not pick up dead foam. Be gentle. Incubate at 37 °C 10 min after rescue. Spin down the cells at 150 x g, 5 min. Resuspend in 300 μl plating media with FBS. Load 5 μl/well, filling the two upper wells of each microfluidic. Let cell adhere at 37 °C for 10 min. Fill the wells from both ends simultaneously with two pipettes with plating media with FBS. Completely change media to fresh plating media W/O FBS 2 h later. Day 6: Change media once again the next morning with plating media. Change half of the media every 2 days.."

        "@value": "Microbial Mutagenicity Assay: Ames Test. The Microbial mutagenicity Ames test is a bacterial bioassay accomplished in vitro to evaluate the mutagenicity of various environmental carcinogens and toxins. While Ames test is used to identify the revert mutations which are present in strains, it can also be used to detect the mutagenicity of environmental samples such as drugs, dyes, reagents, cosmetics, waste water, pesticides and other substances which are easily solubilized in a liquid suspension. We present the protocol for conducting Ames test in the laboratory.. Before performing the experiment, inoculate a single fresh colony of standard strains of S. typhimurium TA 98, 100 and 102, in oxoid nutrient broth-2 and incubate for 10-12 h at 37 °C in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm to ensure sufficient aeration for 1 x 109 bacterial cells. Each strain of S. typhimurium is grown separately in Erlenmeyer flasks (10 ml). Prepare fresh mutagen for each experiment (see Recipes). Negative control: Autoclaved distilled water Positive controls for TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 without S9 metabolic activation (S9 mix): sodium azide (1 μg/ml) 2-nitrofluorine (1 μg/ml) and mitomycin (0.125 μg/ml) For TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 with S9 metabolic activation (S9 mix): 2-Anthramine (2 μg/ml) Preparation of minimal glucose agar (MGA) plates: Mix the medium of minimal glucose agar plates (Recipe 9) and pour 25 ml into each Petri dish. Prepare the plates freshly before use. Label all minimal glucose agar plates and Eppendorf tubes prior to experiment. To the 2 ml sterile Eppendorf tubes, add the following each: 0.1 ml fresh culture of Salmonella strains 0.2 ml of His/Bio solution 0.5 ml sodium phosphate buffer (absence of S9 mix) or 0.5 ml S9 (presence of S9 mix) 0.1 ml of test sample or 0.1 ml of positive or negative control Make up to 1 ml with autoclaved distilled water. Mix the contents of Eppendorf tubes and pour onto Petri plates and spread using L-shaped spreader on the surface of MGA plates. Cover the Petri plates with sterile aluminum foil to protect the testing sample from photo reactive substances. After incubation of 48 h at 37 °C, spontaneous revertants colonies appear and are clearly visible with unaided eyes. All plates are run in triplicates. Revertants form a uniform lawn of auxotrophic bacteria on the surface the background of medium.. The Microbial Ames test is a simple, rapid and robust bacterial assay consisting of different strains and applications of Salmonella typhimurium/E. coli, used for ascertaining the mutagenic potential (Levin et al., 1982; Gupta et al., 2009). In 1975, Ames and his followers standardized the traditional Ames assay protocol and reappraised in 1980’s (Maron and Ames, 1983). Induction of new mutations replacing existing mutations allows restoring of gene function. The newly formed mutant cells are allowed to grow in the absence of histidine and form colonies, hence this test is also called as ‘Reversion assay’ (Ames, 1971). While traditional Ames test is quite laborious and time consuming for initial monitoring of mutagenic compounds, miniaturization of liquid suspension significantly impacted the usability by making it more convenient. The standard doses (2 µl, 5 µl, 10 µl, 50 µl and 100 µl) were set to evaluate the mutagenicity from lower to higher concentration (Hayes, 1982). Mice liver has been used as a tissue for preparing homogenate 9,000 x g (S9 hepatic fraction) whereas in S9 mix, hepatocytes are used to minimize the mammalian metabolic activation formed in the mice liver. In Ames bioassay, the sensitivity of a compound for mutagenicity is based on the knowledge that a substance which is mutagenic in the presence of liver enzymes metabolizing compound might be a carcinogen (Mathur et al., 2005). Genetic Approach: The Salmonella/E. coli tester strains: Several strains of Salmonella typhimurium have been used in Ames assay which requires histidine synthesis to assess the mutagenicity. In the histidine operon, each tester strain contains a different mutation. In addition to the histidine mutation, the standard tester strain of Salmonella typhimurium contains other mutations that greatly enhance their ability to detect the mutations (Figure 1). One of the mutations (rfa) causes partial loss of the lipopolysaccharides barrier that coats the surface of the bacteria and increases permeability to large molecules such as benzo[a]pyrene allowing not to penetrate in the normal cell wall (Mortelman and Zeiger, 2000). The mutagens present in the tested samples give rise to induced revertants on a minimal medium (absence of histidine). They are further used to observe revertants in previously mutated strains (that are not able to grow in a medium without histidine). The other mutation (uvrB) is a deletion mutation in which deletion of a gene, coding for the DNA excision repair system, causing gradually increased sensitivity in detecting many mutagens (Ames et al., 1973a). The reason behind this mutation is the deletion excising the uvrB gene emulsifying these bacteria requiring biotin for growth. The standard strains such as TA 97, TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 contain the R-factor plasmid, pKM101. These R-factor strains are reverted by a number of mutagens that are detected weakly or not at all with the non R-factor parent strains (Ames et al., 1975a).Figure 1. Genetic approach for assessing the mutagenicity in Salmonella strains (modified from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_test)Many studies (Ames et al., 1975b; Levin et al., 1982) revealed that development of plasmid pKM101 in TA 1535 and TA 1538 strains leads to complement other isogenic strains such as TA 98, TA 100, TA 104 and TA 102. The his G46 mutation in TA 100 and TA 1535 codes for the first enzyme of histidine biosynthesis (hisG) (Ames et al., 1975b). This mutation, determined by DNA sequence analysis, substitutes proline (-GGG-) for leucine (-GAG-) in the wild type organism (Barnes et al., 1982). The tester strains TA 1535 and its R-factor derivative present in TA 100, detect mutagens which causes base-pair substitutions generally at one of these G-C pairs. The hisD3052 mutation in TA 1538 and TA 98 is in the hisD gene coding for histodinol dehydrogenase. TA 1538 and its R-factor derivative TA 98 detect various frameshift mutagens in repetitive sequences as ‘hot spots’ resulting in a frame shift mutation (Walker and Dobson, 1979; Shanabruch and Walker, 1980) (Table 1).Table 1. Genotype of the Salmonella strain used for mutagenesis testingLevin et al. (1982) described a standard strain Salmonella typhimurium bacterium called TA 102 which was used to evaluate the effect of some compounds reacting with nucleotides AT. Tester strain TA102 containing nucleotides AT, present in hisG gene carrying plasmid pAQ1. There are certain mutagenic agents which are detected by TA 102 but not by TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98 and TA 100 (Wilcox et al., 1990). Before performing experiment, a new set of fresh strains are prepared; and the genotypes are assessed (R-factor, His, rfa and uvrB mutations). For these, we refer readers to many excellent reviews (Walker, 1979; Czyz et al., 2002; Fluckiger-Isler et al., 2004).Certain carcinogens present in active forms in biological reaction are easily catalyzed by cytochrome-P450. Metabolic activation system is absent in Salmonella, and in order to improve the potentiality of bacterial test systems, liver extracts of Swiss albino mice are used. This serves as a rich source in converting carcinogens to electrophilic chemicals that are incorporated to detect in vivo mutagens and carcinogens (Garner et al., 1972; Ames et al., 1973a). The crude liver homogenate as 9,000 x g S9 fraction contains free endoplasmic reticulum, microsomes, soluble enzymes and some cofactors set with S9 concentration to 10% (Franz and Malling, 1975). The oxygenase requires the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADP) which is generally in situ by the action of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and reducing NADP both work as cofactors in assay (Prival et al., 1984; Henderson et al., 2000). While water is considered as a negative control, sodium azide, 2-nitrofluorine and mitomycin for TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 without S9 metabolic activation and 2-anthramine with S9 hepatic fraction are used as positive controls for conducting the test (Table 2). Before performing the experiment, fresh solutions must be prepared.Table 2. Positive controls with and without S9 metabolic activation (DeFlora et al., 1984)Spontaneous Reversion Control: Each strain of Salmonella contains a specific mutant range. Selection of solvents shows the effect on the frequency range of spontaneous mutant (Maron and Ames, 1983) (Table 3). The range of revertants varies in research laboratories. The spontaneous revertants are visible through unaided eyes (Figure 2).Table 3. Spontaneous revertants control values for various strain types and number of revertants (Mortelmans and Stocker, 1979)Figure 2. Spontaneous revertants colonies obtained after addition of waste water from health center in Salmonella mutagenicity assay at different concentrations, viz. 2 µl, 10 µl, 50 µl, 100 µl (Vijay, 2014)"

        "@value": "CRISPR/Cas9 + AAV-mediated Intra-embryonic Gene Knocking in Mice. Intra-embryo genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled rapid generation of gene knockout animals. However, large fragment knock-in directly into embryos’ genome is still difficult, especially without microinjection of donor DNA. Viral vectors are good transporters of knock-in donor DNA for cell lines, but seemed unsuitable for pre-implantation embryos with zona pellucida, glycoprotein membrane surrounding early embryos. We found adeno-associated virus (AAV) can infect zygotes of various mammals through intact zona pellucida. AAV-mediated donor DNA delivery following Cas9 ribonucleoprotein electroporation enables large fragment knock-in without micromanipulation.. AAV vector plasmid construction Design your AAV vector plasmid and construct it by conventional molecular biological techniques (Green et al., 2012; Behringer et al., 2003). Empty backbone of AAV vector, pAAV-MCS2, is deposited to Addgene. Insert your knock-in cassette flanked by 5′ and 3′ homology arms into your gene of interest between AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). We recommend 300-1,000 bp homology arms for each side, but 100 bp homology arms are still sufficient for the knock-in. Note: AAV genome size (sequence length between ITRs on both ends) should be smaller than 4.8 kb. AAV vector production, extraction and purification Day 0: Seed 4.0-4.5 x 106 293T cells/10 cm dish with 10 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Prepare 8 dishes. Incubate in a 37.0 °C, 10% CO2 incubator (or 5% incubator, alternatively). Day 1: Incubate sterile distilled water, 2.5 M CaCl2, 2x BBS in a 37.0 °C bath for 30-60 min. Vortex briefly. Add 80 μl AAV plasmid (1 mg/ml) and 200 μl pDGM6 (1 mg/ml) into 3,320 μl sterile distilled water in a 15 ml tube (10 μl AAV plasmid, 25 μl pDGM6, 415 μl sterile distilled water for one 10 cm dish transfection, respectively). Vortex briefly. Add 400 μl 2.5 M CaCl2 solution (50 μl for each 10 cm dish transfection) into the 15 ml tuble containting plasmids. Immediately vortex for 10 s. After vortexing, immediately add 4 ml 2x BBS (500 μl for one 10 cm dish transfection), and then shake the 15 ml tubes vigorously. Alternatively, add 2x BBS into the 15 ml tube under continuous vortexing. Incubate at RT for 20 min. Add 1 ml transfection solution (prepared on Procedure B Day 1: Steps 1 to 5) to each 10 cm dish. Incubate in a 37.0 °C, 3% CO2 incubator (or 5% incubator, alternatively). Day 2: Aspirate medium containing transfection solution, and add 5 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS with a 5 ml pipette. Incubate in a 37.0 °C, 10% CO2 incubator (or 5% incubator, alternatively) until Day 4. Day 4: Add x1/80 volume of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) (62.5 μl into 5 ml medium per 10 cm dish). Incubate at RT for 10 min. The cells would be detached from the dish after incubation. Collect 293T cells and culture medium into a 50 ml tube with a 10 ml pipette. Centrifuge at 4 °C, 1,700-2,000 x g, 10 min. Aspirate supernatant. Centrifuge at 4 °C, 1,700-2,000 x g, 1 min to collect residual medium. Aspirate supernatant completely. Vortex the 50 ml tube and dissociate cell pellet. Add 4 ml AAV Extraction Solution A plus (0.5 ml for each 10 cm dish transfection). Vortex for 15 s. Incubate at RT for 5 min. Vortex again for 15 s. Incubate at RT for another 5 min. Vortex again for 15 s. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube at 4 °C, 9,000 x g, 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 50 ml tube with a P1000 tip pipette. Add 400 μl AAV Extraction Solution B (10% volume of AAV Extraction Solution A plus), and mix it gently. Add 40 μl Cryonase Cold-active Nuclease (1% volume of AAV Extraction Solution A plus), and mix it gently. Incubate at 37.0 °C for 60 min. Add 400 μl Precipitator A (10% volume of AAV Extraction Solution A plus). Vortex for 10 s. Incubate at 37.0 °C for 30 min. Vortex for 10 s. Add 200 μl Precipitator B (5% volume of AAV Extraction Solution A plus). Vortex for 10 s. Centrifuge at 4 °C, 9,000 x g, 20 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 50 ml tube with a P1000 tip pipette. Centrifuge again at 4 °C, 9,000 x g, 20 min. Transfer the supernatant to a 6-10 cm dish with a P1000 tip pipette (It might be difficult to aspirate the supernatant from the 50 ml tube directly with a 10 ml syringe). Aspirate the supernatant with a 10 ml syringe, and filtrate it with 0.45 μm PVDF filter into a 15 ml tube. Transfer the filtered supernatant into Amicon Ultra-4, 100 kDa. Centrifuge at 15 °C, 2,000 x g, 5 min. Discard flow-through, add 4 ml 1x PBS onto the filter-unit, and centrifuge at 15 °C, 2,000 x g, 5 min. Repeat the previous ultrafiltration step, 7 times. Collect AAV vector solution with a P200 pipette into a 1.5 ml tube. Approximately 100-120 μl of viral vector suspension would be recovered. Dilute AAV vector solution with 1x PBS up to 200 μl, and dispense 20 μl aliquots in 1.5 ml tubes. Store AAV vector solution at -80 °C. Estimation of AAV vector titer Estimate the AAV vector titer by qPCR (Lock et al., 2014; Werling et al., 2015). Preparation of pronuclear-stage mice embryos Prepare pronuclear-stage mice embryos as described previously (Behringer et al., 2003). Transfer embryos with a fine glass pipette. Administer 5 IU/mouse PMSG into B6D2F1 female mice by intraperitoneal injection at 15:00-18:00 PM. Forty-eight hours after PMSG administration, administer 5 IU/mouse hCG into B6D2F1 female mice by intraperitoneal injection. Immediately after hCG administration, mate female mice with C57BL/6N male mice. 14-16 h after hCG injection, retrieve zygotes from oviduct, and remove surrounding cumulus cells by short-term culture and pipetting in 0.1% hyaluronidase-containing M2 media. Incubate zygotes in KSOM-AA medium at 37.0 °C in 5% CO2 in air atmosphere for 1-4 h. Collect two-pronuclear zygotes. Preparation of Cas9 RNP solution Reconstitute lyophilized crRNA and tracerRNA with Opti-MEM I medium at 100 μM each. Mix 10 μl of crRNA and an equal amount of tracrRNA in PCR tube. Anneal crRNA with tracrRNA in a PCR thermal cycler. Heat it 95 °C for 5 min, and cool it down to 25 °C by 5 °C/min, then keep it at 4 °C. Dilute 100 ng/μl (0.61 μM) Cas9 protein, 200 ng/μl (2.94 μM) annealed gRNA complex (crRNA + tracrRNA) in Opti-MEM I medium. Prepare enough amount of the Cas9 RNP solution; 20-30 μl to wash embryos before electroporation, and 5 μl/run on electroporation. Keep Cas9 RNP solution on ice until the electroporation. Preparation of embryo culture medium containing knock-in donor AAV vector Dilute knock-in donor AAV with KSOM-AA medium at 1 x 107-1 x 108 vg/ml. We recommend 3 x 107 vg/ml for the initial trial, but optimal AAV dose should be determined empirically in each laboratory. Prepare 100 μl drop of KSOM-AA medium containing AAV vector for embryo transduction, and three 100 μl drops of KSOM-AA medium without AAV for washing embryo after electroporation for every 40-60 embryos in a 35-mm non-treated culture dish. Cover it with mineral oil. Incubate the dish at 37.0 °C in 5% CO2 air atmosphere for more than 30 min. Cas9 RNP electroporation and donor AAV transduction Connect 1 mm gap electrode on stereoscopic microscope with the electroporator. DO NOT turn on the thermal plate of microscope during electroporation steps. Otherwise, electrode solution would evaporate immediately (Figure1A). Wash 1 mm gap electrode with 5 μl Opti-MEM I media, 3 times. Prepare 20-30 μl drop of Cas9 RNP solution on 35-mm non-treated culture dish for washing embryos. Wash 20-30 two-pronuclear zygotes with Cas9 RNP solution prepared on Step G3. Add 5 μl Cas9 RNP solution on 1 mm gap electrode. Immediately transfer 20-30 two-pronuclear zygotes on 1 mm gap electrode (Figure 1B). Perform electroporation within 1 min. Condition is as following: 25 V, 3 ms ON, 97 ms OFF, Pd Alt 3-4 times. Collect embryos on the electrode, and wash them with KSOM-AA medium three times. Transfer embryos into KSOM-AA medium containing AAV vector. Incubate embryos at 37.0 °C in 5% CO2 air atmosphere for 16-20 h. Repeat Steps G2-G10 for next run of electroporation. Cas9 RNP solution should be replaced with new 5 μl Cas9 RNP solution for the next 20-30 embryos. Prepare pseudopregnant female by mating proestrus stage ICR female mice with ICR male mice received vasectomy. Sixteen to twenty hours after electroporation, collect embryos at 2-cell stage. Wash embryos with M2 medium three times, and transfer to oviduct of E0.5 pseudopregnant females under anesthesia. Figure 1. Cas9 RNP electroporation of mice zygotes. A. Required equipment for zygote electroporation. The 1 mm gap electrode on the microscope is connected to the electroporator. B. Two-pronuclear zygotes on 1 mm gap electrode. Scale bar, 100 μm.. Genome editing techniques, particularly the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, have significantly simplified the generation of transgenic animals. Conventionally, site-directed transgenesis of mice and rats was developed by founder chimeras with genetically modified pluripotent stem cells, which potentially contribute to the germline. However, this conventional strategy is labor-intensive and does not guarantee the germline transmission. Recently, genome editing has enabled site-directed mutagenesis by allowing the direct introduction of required components into embryos at a 1-cell stage. This alternative strategy eliminates the need for any transgenic donor cells, thus resulting in the rapid generation of founder rodents. The genome editing components Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, are introduced by microinjection into the zygote pronucleus. Although an intra-embryonic microinjection requires advanced training and expensive micromanipulation equipment, it has enabled the gene-knockout as well as knock-in of large-fragments (Yoshimi et al., 2016; Miura et al., 2018). Alternatively, CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein-mediated editing in zygotes can be performed by electroporation; however, large fragment knock-in cannot be efficiently performed (Chen et al., 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2016). The difference between Cas9 RNP-mediated gene knock-in and knockout is the presence of knock-in donor DNA. The donor DNA must be transported inside the cell nucleus; however, this is challenging because of the requirement of a driving force for transport from the cytosol to nucleus as opposed to Cas9 RNP with a nuclear localization signal. Unlike direct microinjection into the pronucleus, electroporation may not introduce a sufficient amount of the donor DNA into the pronucleus. Theoretically, DNA viral vectors are efficient transporters of knock-in donor DNA because they can transfer their genomic DNA to host cells’ nucleus where the in-transit nuclease-mediated degradation of DNA is prevented. However, this strategy seemed unsuitable for pre-implantation embryos possessing a zona pellucida, which inhibits viral infection. In recent studies, we and other groups found AAV can infect mice zygotes with intact zona pellucida (Mizuno et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2018). We have successfully performed knock-in of a large fragment directly into mice embryos via CRISPR/Cas9 RNP electroporation following a trans-zona pellucida delivery of donor DNA using AAV vectors. Here, we demonstrate a detailed protocol for AAV-mediated intra-embryo knock-in in laboratory mice. This technique does not require either micromanipulation or germline competent pluripotent stem cells, which are successfully established only for rodents to date. AAV can infect various mammalian zygotes, including rats and cows. Thus, this simple genome editing method could be potentially applied to several species."

        "@value": "Isolation of Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities from Soil. Rhizosphere bacterial communities have become a major focal point of research in recent years, especially regarding how they affect plants and vice versa (Philippot et al., 2013). Changes in microbial density and diversity within the rhizosphere occur in a spatial temporal manner. The soil zone closest to the plant roots has the most density and diversity of microbes (Clark, 1940). The lack of methods to consistently isolate rhizosphere samples in a spatially defined manner is a major bottleneck in rhizosphere microbiology. We hypothesized that microbes with increasing affinities to and distance from the plant root can be isolated using increasing strengths of physical disruption. Sonication is an excellent choice due to the ability to gently remove rhizosphere soil and bacterial biofilms without damaging plant roots (Doi T et al., 2007; Bulgarelli et al., 2012; Lundberg et al., 2012). In addition, simply increasing the time of sonication can increase the amount of physical force. We used such an approach to consistently isolate microbial communities with different affinities to the soybean roots (White et al., 2014). This article describes the use of successive sonication to isolate distal, middle, and proximal soil from the rhizosphere of soybean roots.. Either directly sow plant seeds or plant seedlings into soil of interest and allow seeds/seedlings to grow for desired amount of time (minimum of 1 week suggested for soybean plants). Notes: Although larger roots (ex. mature tree roots) are not recommended for this procedure, representative samples of the root system can be used depending on the research question. Amount of growth time depends on the research focus, for example the impact of a particular root exudate or the plant growth stage on the soil microbial community. Carefully remove plant seedlings by saturating the soil with dH2O or gently loosening the soil by hand to avoid damage to the roots. Note: Using an excessive amount of dH2O during saturation (i.e. resulting in a soil consistency thinner than mud) risks a loss of sample size and rhizosphere bacteria. Submerge the roots in a still pool of dH2O and gently shake the roots (as if painting a picture or dunking a teabag) to remove the larger soil particles. Skip this step if plant seedlings were removed by soil saturation in the previous step. See Figure 1 for example of soybean roots before and after the removal of large soil particles. Figure 1. Thirty-six day old soybean roots before (A) and after (B) submersion in a still pool of dH2O to remove large soil particles. The amount of soil clinging to the plant roots can vary depending on soil properties, the root architecture, and the size(s) of the plant roots. Use a razor blade to sever the plant roots (cutting near the plant stem). Place the severed roots into separate, labeled 15 ml centrifuge tubes filled with 10 ml of PBST, ensuring they are completely submerged (may use tweezers to gently push roots deeper into the tube). Notes: Roots should be placed into the centrifuge tube vertically. Ensure the centrifuge tube is not packed with the root sample. The number of roots placed into one tube depends on root size and/or the desire to keep root samples separate (ex. pooling all roots from one plant together, pooling multiple roots from several plants together, or keeping each root from one plant separate). Overly large roots, or too many roots in one tube, will lead to poor sample isolation whereas tiny roots, or too few roots in one tube, will yield a miniscule sample size. For seedlings with larger root systems, use a 50 ml centrifuge tube filled with 45 ml of PBST in this step and all subsequent steps. See Figure 2 for demonstrative sample of an acceptable amount of roots in a single tube. Figure 2. Soybean roots submerged in 10 ml of PBST within a 15 ml centrifuge tube Firmly secure the centrifuge tube lids, then place the tubes in a floating raft within a sonicator filled with dH2O. Note: Ensure the centrifuge tubes do not touch the bottom or sides of the sonicator (see Figure 3 for demonstrative diagram). Figure 3. Diagram demonstrating how to properly load samples and floating raft into the sonicator filled with dH2O. Centrifuge tubes should be submerged up to the 10 or 45 ml line (dependent on if a 15 or 50 ml centrifuge tube was used). Tubes should not touch the bottom or edges of the sonicator. Subject the centrifuge tubes to sonication for 60 sec, then turn off the sonicator (see Figure 4 for sonication summary). Notes: This sonication yields the rhizosphere soil furthest from the plant root or soil with least affinity to the plant root, noted as the “distal soil” sample. Use the same sonication time for both the 15 and 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Figure 4. Diagram of successive sonication procedure for isolation of distal, middle, and proximal soil samples from plant roots. Distal soil samples consist of the rhizosphere soil furthest from and with least affinity to the plant root. Middle soil samples consist of the rhizosphere soil that is closer to and with relatively less affinity the plant root. Proximal soil samples consist of the rhizosphere soil closest to and with highest affinity the plant root. Image adapted from a previous article (White et al., 2014). Using tweezers, gently remove the root(s) from the current centrifuge tube(s) and transfer into a new, labeled centrifuge tube (or tubes) containing 10 ml of fresh PBST. Note: Keep roots/samples separated in the same manner used for the first sonication. Do not pool roots/samples from different centrifuge tubes together. Firmly secure the centrifuge tube lids, place the tubes in the floating raft within the sonicator, and subject the tubes to sonication for 60 sec. Then turn off the sonicator. Note: This sonication yields the rhizosphere soil that is closer to the plant root, noted as the “middle soil” sample. Using tweezers, gently remove the root(s) from the current centrifuge tube(s) and transfer into a new, labeled 15 ml centrifuge tube (or tubes) containing 10 ml of fresh PBST. Note: Again, keep roots/samples separated in the same manner used for the first sonication. Do not pool roots/samples from different centrifuge tubes together. Firmly secure the centrifuge tube lids, place the tubes in the floating raft within the sonicator, and subject the tubes to sonication for 10 min. Then turn off the sonicator. Note: This sonication yields the rhizosphere soil closest to the plant root including any biofilms, noted as the “proximal soil” sample. At this point, soil should not be visible on the plant root. Using tweezers, gently remove the root(s) from the current centrifuge tube(s) and either discard the roots or place them into a new, labeled centrifuge tube (or tubes) filled with fresh PBST, then store the tubes at 4 °C until needed. Harvested samples may then be immediately used for bacterial cultivation or further processed for DNA or RNA isolation. If seeking to isolate DNA or RNA, complete the next 2 steps of the protocol. For bacterial cultivation, promptly subject the samples to a series of 6 to 10 fold dilutions using sterile dH2O and select several of these dilutions for plating (dilutions >10-3 recommended). When plating the chosen dilutions, ensure the appropriate nutrient medium (or media) is chosen. One hundred microliters of the chosen dilution should be dispensed onto the center of the petri dish and spread across the media using a flame-sterilized glass spreader. The petri dish should then be inverted and incubated under the ideal cultivating conditions (i.e. time and temperature). See Figure 5 for an example of bacterial cultivation via petri dish. Notes: Distal, middle, and proximal soil samples are all useful for bacterial cultivation. However, proximal soil samples are preferable as they contain the bacteria that most likely affect the plant directly and vice versa. Possible media for bacterial cultivation include a soil extract medium such as SESOM, DR2A + supplements, and R2A solidified with agar or gellan (Tamaki et al., 2005; Vilain et al., 2006). Figure 5. Bacterial cultivation of proximal soil samples from untransformed soybean roots on nutrient media solidified with agar (A-C) or gellan (D-F). Nutrient media consisted of DR2A+ (A, D), R2A (B, E), and SESOM (C, F). Bacterial samples acquired from a 10-5 dilution. Black dots and red circles indicate the presence of individual bacterial colonies. After securing the lids on all the centrifuge tubes, place them into a 4 °C centrifuge and subject them to centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min or 4,500 x g for 15 min (depending on the limits of the centrifuge). Once centrifugation is complete, discard supernatant and either immediately use the pellets for DNA or RNA isolation or store them at -80 °C until needed.."

        "@value": "Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay for Acinetobacter baumannii. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that can inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation. MIC determination is used as not only a diagnostic tool in treating bacterial infections for clinicians but also a research method in evaluating the efficacy of an antimicrobial. Multidrug resistance Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has emerged in recent years. Accurate determination of resistance by MIC assay is important in coping with this superbug. Here we described a protocol for determining MIC for A. baumannii in hope of assisting researchers and physicians in confirming resistance of clinical isolates correctly.. Preparation of antibiotic stock solution and dilution range Obtain antibiotic powder from the pharmaceutical company and make a note of the relevant information, including expiry date, potency, stability and solubility. Prepare 1 ml 10 mg/ml tigecycline stock solution. Choose a suitable range of antibiotic concentrations to be tested for A. baumannii if available. If the range is not available, maximal concentration 512 µg/ml and serial diluted concentrations with CAMHB solution are used. The lowest dilution concentration is depended on the possible minimal inhibition concentration. 0.125 µg/ml is the lowest possible dilution concentration. To get different tested concentrations, solution of 10-time maximal concentration is prepared by dispensing the appropriate amount of stock solutions with micropipette and diluting with CAMHB solution. For example, to get 1 ml 5,120 µg/ml solution, dispense 0.512 ml stock solution and dilute with 0.488 ml CAMHB solution. Preparation of inoculum Dissolve a single colony of A. baumannii, which is picked from a LB streak plate, in 3 ml LB broth and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 220 rpm. Check OD600 (1 OD600= 109 CFU/ml) with a spectrophotometer. Dilute the bacterial solution with LB broth to get 0.1 OD600 suspension and incubate at 37 °C, 220 rpm till mid-log phase (~2 h). Put 1 ml mid-log phase bacterial solution in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for five min, and wash with 1 ml PBS solution. Repeat the washing procedure twice. Dissolve the bacterial pellet with 1 ml CAMHB solution. Get 100 µl the above bacterial solution and mix it with 900 µl PBS, then check OD600 with a spectrophotometer. The bacterial concentration can be deduced from the measured value x 10. Adjust the bacterial concentration to 1 x 107 CFU/ml with CAMHB solution (1 OD600 ~109 CFU/ml). Inoculation and incubation Mix 50 µl adjusted A. baumannii bacterial solution (1x107 CFU/ml), 850 µl CAMHB and 100 µl solutions of 10-time serial tested antibiotic concentration. Use the E. coli ATCC25922 bacterial solution as a control. Use 900 µl CAMHB and 100 µl solutions of 10-time serial tested antibiotic concentration for OD600 measurement comparison as a negative control. Incubate at 37 °C, 220 rpm for 20-24 h. Reading and interpretation Check OD600 with a spectrophotometer. Read the MIC endpoint as the lowest concentration of antibiotic at which there is no visible growth of bacteria (no solution turbidity on naked eyes), and the difference of measured and background OD600 is less than 0.01.."

This protocol provides a general workflow for establishing a soft-agar colony formation assay.. Cells that have been knocked down or been treated with other procedures like drugs or some interferences are harvested and pipetted well to become single-cell suspension in complete culture media in a given concentration (such as 1 x 106/ml). They are then put at room temperature and should be ready to use. At the same time, pre-warm 10% FBS DMEM at 37 °C, ready to use. Melt 4% agar (in glass bottle) by microwave and keep warm in 56 °C water bath, ready to use (remember don’t melt the gel too many times, you will lose water and concentrate the gel). Make bottom layer. Make 5 ml of 10% FBS DMEM containing 0.75% agar (the volume of 4% agar was calculated by: 5 ml multiply 0.75%=X multiply 4%). Therefore, you need to quickly take about 0.9 ml 4% agar from the bottle in water bath and mix it with 4.1 ml pre-warmed of 10% FBS DMEM well and put the mixture into 60-mm culture dish in the flow hood. Wait a few minutes for it to become solid. Make the top layer. It contains 3 x 104 cells in 3 ml of 10% FBS DMEM and 0.36% agar. Dilute the single-cell suspension to 3 x 104 (or 1.5 x 104) in 3ml of 10% FBS DMEM (1 x 104/ml). You need to mix 2.73 ml pre-warmed 10% FBS DMEM cell suspension with 270 μl of 4% pre-warmed agar (56 °C). You have to do this fast and no bubble. To avoid this problem, you can make 6 ml (double) of this mixture and put 3 ml on the top of bottom layer. The best way to do this is to use 1 ml pipette tip to add from one side. The mixture will flow through the whole bottom layer. Do not shake the dish. It will become solid within seconds. Now the dish contains 2 layers. Mark the dish and put it at 37 °C incubator for 3 weeks. Then the colonies were stained with 0.04% crystal violet-2% ethanol in PBS. Photographs of the stained colonies should be taken. Note: 4% Agar should be prepared in DD water then autoclave it. If the colony number is too high to count, you can decrease cells to a total of 1.5 x 104. This would be easy to count. Before you mix agarose gel with medium and cells. You should get pipette, tips ready to use, and perform it as fast as possible.."

        "@value": "Analysis of Intestinal Permeability in Mice. The intestinal epithelial layer serves as a barrier against pathogens and ingested toxins, which are present in the lumen of the intestine. The importance of the intestinal epithelial barrier is emphasized by the alterations in paracellular permeability and tight junction functions observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer.. On day 1, in the evening remove water bottles from the cages to water starve the mice overnight. On day 2, in the morning weight the mice. Dissolve FITC-dextran in PBS at a concentration of 100 mg/ml and administer FITC-dextran to each mouse (44 mg/100 g body weight) by oral gavage with a needle attached to a 1 ml syringe. The procedure for oral gavage is described elsewhere (Bertola et al., 2013). A gap of 30 min between each mouse is recommended for the FITC-dextran oral gavage (see Notes). After 4 h, anesthetize the mice by isoflurane inhalation and collect the blood using a 1 ml syringe with 25 G needle by cardiac puncture, then kill the mice by cervical dislocation. Isoflurane is delivered at a concentration of 4% in oxygen using a precision vaporizer for the initial induction and then is maintained at 3% during the blood collection. Typically, we collect 300-400 μl of blood in order to get enough serum for the next step. Immediately, transfer blood to a Microtainer SST tube, mix by inverting the tube 3-4 times and store at 4 °C in in the dark. Once blood has been collected from all the mice, SST tubes are processed to separate the serum following the manufacturer’s instruction. Dilute the serum with an equal volume of PBS. Add 100 μl of diluted serum to a 96-well microplate in duplicate. Determine the concentration of FITC in serum by spectrophoto fluorometry with an excitation of 485 nm (20 nm band width) and an emission wavelength of 528 nm (20 nm band width) using as standard serially diluted FITC-dextran (0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000 ng/ml) (Figure 1). Serum from mice not administered with FITC-dextran is used to determine the background.."

        "@value": "Measurement of Chlorophyll a and Carotenoids Concentration in Cyanobacteria. This is a protocol for precise measurement of chlorophyll a and total carotenoid concentrations in cyanobacteria cells. Cellular chlorophyll concentration is one of the central physiological parameters, routinely followed in many research areas ranging from stress physiology to biotechnology. Carotenoids concentration is often related to cellular stress level; combined pigments assessment provides useful insight into cellular physiological state. The current protocol was established to minimize time and equipment requirements for the routine pigments analysis. It is important to note that this protocol is suitable only for cyanobacteria containing chlorophyll a, and is not designed for species containing other chlorophyll molecules.. Work under modest irradiance [up to 5 µmol (photons) m-2 s-1 of white light or 10 µmol (photons) m-2 s-1 of green light] in order to prevent degradation of extracted pigments. Harvest 1 ml of cyanobacterial culture suspension (Note 2). Centrifuge cells at 15,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 7 min and thoroughly discard supernatant. If necessary repeat the centrifugation (Note 3). Add 1 ml of methanol, precooled to +4 °C. Homogenize the sample by mixing (Silamat S6, 2 sec), vortexing (2,000 rpm, 4 sec), or by gentle pipetting up and down. Cover the samples with aluminum foil. Incubate at +4 °C for 20 min in order to extract the pigments from the cells (Note 4). Centrifuge at 15,000 x g, +4 °C for 7 min and visually check pellet; it should be ranging between bluish and purple (Figure 1) with no green color. If the pellet is green, repeat steps 5-6. Figure 1. Colors of cyanobacteria pellets before addition of methanol (A) and after chlorophyll a and carotenoids extraction (B). The color of pellets after the methanol extraction will be ranging from bluish (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) to purple (Lyngbya sp. IPPAS B-1204), depending on particular combination of phycobiliproteins. Calibrate spectrophotometer using methanol as blank. Measure pigments concentration by spectrophotometer with slit width 1 nm. Measure absorbance of sample and blank at 470 nm, 665 nm and 720 nm (Note 5). Calculate concentration of chlorophyll a content according to equations: Chla [µg/ml] = 12.9447 (A665 − A720) (Ritchie, 2006) Chla [µM] = 14.4892 (A665 − A720); for Chla molar mass = 893.4890 g/mol Carotenoids [µg/ml] = [1,000 (A470 − A720) − 2.86 (Chla [µg/ml])] / 221 (Wellburn, 1994). Perform the analysis at least in triplicates as necessary for calculations of averages and standard deviations from each pigments assessment.."

        "@value": "Gallyas Silver Impregnation of Myelinated Nerve Fibers. In the nervous system of vertebrates, nerve impulse propagation is accelerated by the ensheathment of neuronal axons with myelin. Myelin sheaths are molecularly specialized, lipid-rich plasma membrane extensions of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). To visualize myelinated nerve fibers and to allow for the morphological analyses of myelin in the brain and the spinal cord, an efficient method for silver impregnation of myelin has originally been developed by Ferenc Gallyas in 1979, referred to as Gallyas silver impregnation. Gallyas’ method is based on the agyrophilic characteristic of myelin to form and bind silver particles, while this process is suppressed in tissues other than myelin. The silver particles are finally enhanced in a developing step (“physical developer”). The main advantage of this method is that it efficiently visualizes both large myelinated fiber tracts and individual myelinated axons. Here we provide our laboratory protocol that is suitable for paraffin embedded sections and the use of light microscopy based on Gallyas’ original protocol and subsequent modifications by Pistorio and colleagues.. Paraffin embedding and microtome sectioning Carefully remove the brain or spinal cord and post-fix it in 4% PFA for tissue for one hour up to overnight at 4 °C in a 50 ml Falcon. Note: Prior to paraffin embedding of the brain, mice were subjected to transcardial perfusion. Embed the brain in paraffin by using an automated embedding machine for best results. Use the recommended protocol of your embedding machine. If no particular protocol is recommended, use the following protocol: Reagent Duration 50% ethanol 1 h 70% ethanol 2x 2 h 96% ethanol 2x 1 h 100% ethanol 2x 1 h 2-propanol 1 h xylene 2x 2 h paraffin 2x 2 h Cut 5 µm sections using a microtome and mount sections on microscope glass slides. Air-dry at room temperature (RT). Store at room RT for future use. Note: A thickness of 5 µm is optimal for subsequent light microscopy. Mounting on slides is most conservative to the integrity of the sections. Gallyas silver impregnation (Overview of protocol see Figure 1) De-paraffinize sections by incubating for 10 min each in xylene, again xylene and 2-propanol/xylene (1:1). Afterwards incubate sections in 100%, 90%, 70%, 50% ethanol and distilled water (dH2O) for 5 min each. Note: Formalin-fixed sections are also suitable for subsequent Gallyas silver staining as described in Pistorio et al., 2005. The conservation of morphology in paraffin sections however is superior to crysections. To suppress staining of non-myelin tissue, incubate sections in pyridine/acetic anhydride (2:1, e.g., 200 ml of pyridine and 100 ml of acetic anhydride) for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Note: Prepare solution fresh, stored solution will turn yellow and needs to be discarded. Wash 3 times with dH2O, for 10 min each. Submerge sections in incubation solution, microwave for 2 min at 440 W. The incubation solution must not come to boil. The temperature should reach approximately 50 °C. Let it cool down for 10 min at RT until lukewarm. Wash sections 3 times in 0.5% acetic acid for 5 min each. Develop sections in physical developing solution for 3-15 min. After 1-2 min, start monitoring the reaction under the microscope by placing the sections in 1% acetic acid (= interrupts developing reaction). To determine if staining has reached the desired intensity, compare to the optimal result shown in Figure 2. The color of myelin should be dark brown and should display a good contrast as compared to the background. If too pale, the sections can be exposed once again to the physical developing solution. Repeat until optimal result is reached. Stop the staining reaction by incubating sections 3 times in 1% acetic acid for 5 min each. Wash twice in dH2O for 3 min each. Incubate sections in 2% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min to fix the stain. Wash twice with dH2O for 5 min each. Dehydrate section in 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% ethanol for each 5 min, followed by 2-propanol/xylene (1:1), xylene and again xylene for 10 min each. Mount sections with Eukitt and cover slips. Note: Sections, stored in slides boxes at RT, have a shelf life of many years. Result: Myelin and erythrocytes are stained black, sometimes nuclei are stained too, background is pale yellow (Figure 2). Figure 1. Flowchart depicting individual steps and time specification of deparaffinization, staining, rehydration and mounting procedures Microscopy Images can be acquired using a light microscope at different magnifications (Figure 2). Figure 2. Gallyas silver impregnation of a mouse brain. Sagittal view of a 3 month-old mouse brain subjected to the Gallyas protocol described here. Depicted are different regions of the brain: A. hippocampus, B. cortex, C. cerebellum, D. striatum, E. midbrain. CC = corpus callosum, CI = capsula interna, CP = caudoputamen. Scale bar = 100 μm.. Myelin is the multilayered, molecularly specialized plasma membrane of oligodendrocytes in the CNS or Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system that accelerates nerve conduction by ensheathing axons (for comprehensive reviews: Hildebrand et al., 1993; Kidd et al., 2013; Nave and Werner, 2014; Monk et al., 2015; Simons and Nave, 2015). The myelination of axons provides electrical insulation and thus facilitates saltatory impulse propagation in a highly efficient manner (Tasaki, 1939; Hartline and Colman, 2007). In addition to insulation, myelinating cells may provide trophic support for myelinated axons (Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003; Nave, 2010; Funfschilling et al., 2012; Joseph et al., 2019).Electron microscopy reveals morphologically distinguishable subcompartments of myelin. The compacted myelin comprises alternating electron-dense and electron-lucent layers while the adaxonal myelin layer and paranodal myelin loops remain non-compacted. At the light microscopic level, large myelinated tracts (i.e., the white matter including the corpus callosum) are clearly distinguishable from the grey matter, in which the majority of axons is non-myelinated. However, even largely unmyelinated CNS regions including the cortex comprise individual myelinated axons that appear as fine fibers if visualized by specific staining.Ferenc Gallyas described in 1979 a method to specifically visualize myelin in the brain (Gallyas, 1979). A fundamental step is the treatment of the CNS tissue with pyridine and acetic anhydride, which during the subsequent silver impregnation prevents the absorption of silver ions by tissues other than myelin. Another critical step is the physical developer, which contains silver nitrate and tungstosilicic acid, which, once added, reduces silver ions to elemental silver. In 2005, Pistorio and colleagues described a modified version of this method by Gallyas (Pistorio et al., 2006). Here, we provide our lab protocol based on these previous versions. The major difference is the use of a microwave to decrease the staining time as heat causes the molecules to diffuse rapidly across tissues. Other differences include a slight modification in the recipe of the physical developer and the absence of a de-staining step involving potassium ferricyanide. In recent years, silver impregnation of myelin has been mainly used to assess myelinated tracts in mouse mutants (de Monasterio-Schrader et al., 2012; Werner et al., 2013; Patzig et al., 2016; Erwig et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 2019), yet the method can be applied to various species and scientific questions. As we describe the silver impregnation of paraffinated brain sections, we included the paraffin embedding and the de-paraffinization procedure."

        "@value": "Fractionation by Ultracentrifugation of Gram Negative Cytoplasmic and Membrane Proteins. Protein fractionation is a useful separation process which divides membrane proteins (including those located in the outer and inner membrane) and cytoplasmic proteins into discrete fractions. Fractionation of proteins can simplify analysis of the numbers of proteins present, and therefore make easier to characterize any environmentally or mutation induced changes in expression profiles, or changes in protein strucutre resulting from post-translational modification. This protocol is derived from Haigh et al. (2013) and it is specific to Gram negative bacteria.. The bacteria should be cultured in media appropriate for the bacterial species under investigation or the environmental condition being tested. Cultures can be at logarithmic or stationary phase, although stationary phase cultures can be harder to lyse for protein extraction. Harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 6,708 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, discard the culture supernatant (unless it is needed to analyse secreted protein profiles). Wash the pellet by re-suspending it uniformly with buffer to a volume at 50 times that of the pellet (e.g. the pellet from a 200 ml stationary phase E. coli culture would be around 2 ml in volume and would need at least 100 ml of buffer), then re-centrifuge at 6,708 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Repeat this wash step. For separation of E. coli membrane proteins the pellet should be washed in 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5) (this buffer can be used with any proteins from any cellular source). For small volume culture protein fractionations (e.g. 25 ml) an overnight growth will give an OD600 of approximately 2; once harvested and washed, this would be re-suspended in 0.5-1 ml 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5), to give a final cell density of OD600 of 20-30 (the suspension should have the appearance of pouring cream). For large volume culture (e.g. 200 ml) re-suspend in 5-10 ml 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5). If proteolysis is likely to be a problem, a cocktail of broad spectrum protease inhibitors should be included at the levels recommended by the manufacturer. Freeze the culture suspension at -80 °C for 2 h or overnight to weaken the cell wall and increase the lysis of the bacterial cells by sonication. Thaw the bacterial suspension on ice and place it in a non-breakable plastic beaker sitting in an ice water bath. Set the sonicator between 6-8 microns and lyse the cells in cycles of 15 sec sonication followed by 45 sec cooling until the lysate changes from an opaque solution into a less turbid solution (usually 4-5 cycles are enough for log phase cells; stationary phase cultures may need more treatments). Centrifuge the lysed sample at 6,708 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove large debris fragments and unlysed cells (these will be contained in the pellet) and transfer the supernatant containing the total protein extract (membrane and cytoplasmic) into appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes. Ultracentrifuge the protein extract at 108,726 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate membrane proteins from cytoplasmic proteins. After the centrifugation the supernatant will contain the cytoplasmic proteins while the pellet contains the total membrane protein. If only a total membrane proteins fraction is required (comprising both inner and outer membrane proteins) then go to step 11, if only the outer membrane and inner membrane proteins fractions are required go to step 11 and then 10. The pellet consisting of total membrane proteins is re-suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 2% Triton X-100 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (TT; e.g. for a small volume culture initially of 25 ml re-suspend in 100-200 μl of TT); the inner membrane proteins are solubilised by incubation at room temperature with occasional mixing for 30 min. The mixture is then again centrifuged at 108,726 x g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant will contain the inner membrane protein fraction whereas the insoluble pellet will contain the outer membrane protein. To remove any residual inner membrane proteins, the outer membrane pellet is re-extracted for a further 30 min in 500 μl of TT (this step is only to purify the outer membrane proteins and so the supernatant should be discarded). Note: The extra wash/extraction steps are needed to increase the relative purity of the different fractions. Sometime it is possible that there are carry over between the fractions especially if people do not take care to remove all supernatants between centrifugations (but that's is more a procedure error). Generally, we determined that two washes are enough to obtain a pure membrane fraction. We tested the purity of the protein fraction by separating them on SDS gel and subjecting the proteins to sequencing. However, more washes steps can be increased to enhance the purity if required. Wash the total membrane pellet twice or outer membrane pellet once in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); for a small volume culture initially of 25 ml, 500 μl of buffer would be sufficient. Finally, re-suspend in 30-50 μl of the same buffer according to the membrane pellet size. The concentration of the cytoplasmic and membrane protein samples should be measured using the Bradford assay (He, 2011a) or via a spectrophotometer set at 280 nm. For storage, proteins should be contained in capped 1.5 or 2 ml sterile plastic tubes, and stored at -20 °C for around 1 month or -80 °C for 6 months or longer. Protein extracts should be thawed on ice and always kept at 0-4 °C for the minimum amount of time to maximize stability and protein activity. For simple 1-dimensional SDS PAGE, normalized protein samples are mixed with adequate amounts of 2x SDS protein sample buffer and the gel electrophoresis carried out as described by He (2011b) (for 1D SDS-gel electrophoresis). The protein fractions can also be separated by 2D gel electrophoresis if required.."

        "@value": "Mouse Cochlear Whole Mount Immunofluorescence. This protocol comprises the entire process of immunofluorescence staining on mouse cochlea whole mount, starting from tissue preparation to the mounting of the tissue. This technique provides “three-dimensional” views of the stained components in order to determine the localization of a protein of interest in the tissue in its natural state and environment.. Cochlea extraction and perfusion Anesthetize mice (mice overdosed with 200 μl of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride, 100 mg/ml and xylazine hydrochloride 10 mg/ml, per 100 g of mouse weight). Pinch the toes to check if the animal is fully asleep then decapitate the mouse. Quickly and carefully remove cochleae from skull and put them in a Petri dish as follow: Cut the mouse head in half. Remove brain. Hold head on side so the 'bowl' of the skull is facing up. The temporal bone is in the back and is not continuous to the skull (there are many small bones attaching it to the skull). Push in the junctions between the skull and the temporal bone (away from the cochlea area) to break it away from skull. Carefully dissect extraneous bones away from the cochlea. The following video by Parker et al. (2010) shows, between min 3 and 4, how to dissect the temporal bone (cochlea) from a P3-5 mouse. The same procedure is done for an older mouse, but the only difference is the bone cochlea becomes harder. http://www.jove.com/video/1685/primary-culture-plasmid-electroporation-murine-organ Use a syringe to push approximately 0.5 ml of ice cold 4% PFA-PB through the round and oval windows (RW and OW) after having made a small hole in the apex of the cochlea (for orientation refer to the whole cochlea picture with legends in Figure 1 (Glen et al., 2008)). Figure 1. Shows a mouse decalcified left temporal bone. This labeled picture helps for orientation on the mouse anatomy of the whole temporal bone needed for good success in reproducing this protocol [this picture was borrowed from MacDonald et al. (2008) paper]. Note: To have a very good fixation, the round window membrane should be punctured and the stapes should be removed before cochlea perfusion. Post-fix the cochleae in 5 ml 4% PFA-PB for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Using 1 ml syringe rinse cochlea by perfusing 3 times PB through the RW and OW. Wash 3 x 15 min in fresh PB at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Cochlea decalcification and organ of Corti dissection into surface preparation Transfer the cochleae to 5 ml tube containing 5% EDTA and incubate at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Post-natal Age < P7 P7-P15 P15-P21 P21 Time in 5% EDTA 1-2 h 2-4 h 5-8 h 12- 24 h Note: Before going to next step, you need to check if the cochleae are very well decalcified. Insufficient decalcification will not help to get an intact and good organ of Corti. A good decalcification is when the cochleae become soft at touch with forceps and when the cochlea bone becomes transparent. A picture of decalcified cochlea is present in the following video. http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/ent/eaton-peabody/epl-histology-resources/video-tutorial-for-cochlear-dissection/ Wash 3 x 15 min in fresh PB at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The otic capsule, the lateral wall, Reissner’s membrane and tectorial membrane should be removed in that order and then dissect the organ of Corti (for orientation on the cochlea anatomy see the cochlea mid-turn cross section Figure 2). Figure 2. Shows a mid-modular cross section of the mouse cochlea turn stained with toluidine blue. This labeled 20x view section helps for orientation on the mouse cochlea anatomy needed in this protocol for good success in reproducing this protocol. The remaining organ of Corti was further dissected into a surface preparation and microdissected into individual turns. Note: The video of Liberman's laboratory shows a method of surface preparation dissection that better preserves the overall structure of the organ of Corti. http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/ent/eaton-peabody/epl-histology-resources/video-tutorial-for-cochlear-dissection/ Immunofluorescence Microdissected cochlea individual turns were then placed in a 0.5 ml Ependorf tube cap containing blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) on a rocking platform. Incubate in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Note: Putting the cap with cochlea turns in a small Petri dish and wrapping them with parafilm will prevent dehydration. Rinse 3 x 15 min in PBS. Incubate with secondary antibodies in PBS for 2 h at RT on a rocking platform. Note: Because the secondary antibodies are sensitive to light, the tissue should be wrapped with aluminum foil to protect it from light. Rinse 3x 15 min in PBS. Stain the nuclei with DAPI in PBS for 15 min at RT. Rinse 3 x 15 min in PBS. Mount the cochlea whole mount turn carefully onto slides. Note: The orientation is very important in mounting the whole mount organ of Corti. The hair cells stereocilia should face up and be in contact with the coverslip, while the basilar membrane labeled green in Figure 2 should be on the bottom and be in contact with the slide. The video of Liberman's laboratory shows the correct orientation of the cochlea surface preparation a slide of the video is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3. Shows a slide of the video of Liberman's laboratory. “http://www.masseyeandear.org/research/ent/eaton-peabody/epl-histology-resources/video-tutorial-for-cochlear-dissection/” presenting the correct orientation and preparation of the whole mount organ of Corti. The hair cells stereocilia should face up and be in contact with the coverslip, while the basilar membrane labeled green in Figure 2 should be on the bottom and be in contact with the slide. At this step if the orientation of the cochlea surface preparation is done properly it provides very good views of the stained components under the microscope. Apply a drop of antifades solution, coverslip and then let it dry. Slides are now ready to be observed under a microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Note: For better images use a confocal immunofluorescence microscope and do not expose your slides too much to light to avoid stain bleaching. Figure 2 in Akil et al. (2012) Neuron paper is a sample of the Mouse Cochlear Whole Mount Immunofluorescence.."

        "@value": "Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide by DAB Staining in Arabidopsis Leaves Updated. In this protocol, the in situ detection of hydrogen peroxide (one of several reactive oxygen species) is described in mature Arabidopsis rosette leaves by staining with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) using an adaptation of previous methods (Thordal-Christensen et al., 1997; Bindschedler et al., 2006; Daudi et al., 2012). DAB is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of some haem-containing proteins, such as peroxidases, to generate a dark brown precipitate. This precipitate is exploited as a stain to detect the presence and distribution of hydrogen peroxide in plant cells. The protocol can be modified slightly to detect hydrogen peroxide in different types of plant tissue.. Preparation of DAB staining solution In 50 ml Falcon tube, add 50 mg DAB and 45 ml sterile H2O for a final 1 mg ml-1 DAB solution. Add small magnetic stirrer and reduce pH to 3.0 with 0.2 M HCl (to dissolve DAB). Cover tube with aluminium foil since DAB is light-sensitive. Add 25 μl Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) and 2.5 ml 200 mM Na2HPO4 to the stirring DAB solution. This will generate a 10 mM Na2HPO4 DAB staining solution and will pull the pH back up again. Note: Sometimes the DAB will still not fully dissolve, but usually very high levels of homogeneity in the solution are achieved. The DAB solution is only good for the day, made fresh. Staining leaves with DAB solution Grow Arabidopsis plants under normal conditions, or as per your requirements. Select rosette leaves on plants that are just pre-bolting (3-4 weeks typically). Apply treatment of choice, for example wounding or pathogen infiltration. As an example, we typically apply 100 μl of microbial elicitor solution dissolved in water (e.g. 0.5 μM Flg22) injected directly into the leaf via a 1 ml needleless syringe. Flg22 is a bacterial peptide epitope that is commonly used to trigger innate immune responses in plants. Ensure that similar, mature rosette leaves are selected for your treatment of choice. Sample at least 3 leaves per plant from 6 independent plants (biological replicates). It is good practice to repeat the entire experiment at least once to generate robust data. Allow plants to incubate depending on treatment. We typically leave the plants for 1 h if we are studying biotic stress responses following Flg22 infiltration for example. Sample the leaves at the desired time point by manually removing each leaf from the plant and placing in a 12-well microtiter plate. It is ok to place two or three leaves in one well. Apply 2 ml of the DAB staining solution to the leaf or leaves in the well. Adjust the volume to ensure that leaves are immersed. Note: It may be difficult to judge because these leaves are naturally hydrophobic, but if there is enough liquid for the total leaf tissue volume, then shaking the plate in the following steps will ensure that all parts of the leaf are in contact with the solution. Apply 2 ml of 10 mM Na2HPO4 as the control treatment for replicate leaves. Ensure that the DAB solution is taken up by the leaf by gently vacuum infiltrating the leaves. This is achieved by placing the 12-well plates in a dessicator and applying gentle vacuum for 5 min. Cover the 12-well plate with aluminium foil (since DAB is light-sensitive). Place the plate on a standard laboratory shaker for 4-5 h at 80-100 rpm shaking speed. Note: 4 h is optimum time for the DAB stain to develop for many biotic interactions where the level of hydrogen peroxide produced is quite high. It is perfectly fine to increase this incubation time if the interaction being studied produces lower levels of sustained hydrogen peroxide production. We have tried up to 8 h staining with no detrimental effects observed in the assay. Following the incubation, remove the foil and replace the DAB staining solution with bleaching solution (ethanol:acetic acid:glycerol = 3:1:1). Place the 12-well plate carefully in a boiling water bath (~90-95 °C setting on water bath is OK) for 15 min. This will bleach out the chlorophyll but leave the brown precipitate formed by the DAB reacting with the hydrogen peroxide. The time can be adjusted by ± 5 min depending on the appearance of the leaves (they should be completely devoid of chlorophyll). After 15 ± 5 min of boiling, replace the bleaching solution with fresh bleaching solution and allow to stand for 30 min. Samples at this stage can be stored at 4 °C for up to 4 days with no detrimental effects observed in our hands. Leaves can be directly visualized for DAB staining. Photographs are recommended on a plain white background under uniform lighting.."

        "@value": "Dimethylmethylene Blue Assay (DMMB). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of repeating disaccharide units composed of a hexosamine (glucosamine or galactosamine) and a hexuronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid). Depending on the disaccharide unit the GAGs can be organized into five groups: chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronic acid. The GAGs are heterogeneous molecules with great variability in molecular mass and both sulfation density and pattern. Spectrophotometric assays to measure the GAG content in biological fluids and tissue/cell extracts are valuable tools. The dye 1,9-dimethylmethylene is a thiazine chromotrope agent that presents a change in the absorption spectrum due to the induction of metachromasia when bound to sulfated GAGs enabling rapid detection of GAGs in solution (Whitley et al., 1989; Chandrasekhar et al., 1987; Farndale et al., 1982). Moreover, there is a window in which a linear curve may be drawn (approximately between 0.5-5 μg of GAGs) enabling the quantification of GAGs in solution.. Prepare DMMB reagent and paper filter using Whattman® 3MM. The pH of this solution is around 3.0. To prepare 1 L dye solution, dissolve 16 mg DMMB in 1 L water containing 3.04 g glycine, 1.6 g NaCl and 95 ml of 0.1 M Acetic Acid. Prepare standard solution of chondroitin 4 sulfate (500 µg/ml in H2O). Prepare standard curve as stated in the table bellow. Pipet the standard stock solution and complete the volume to 20 µl with H2O into the 96 well microplate. Pipet 20 µl of each sample into the microplate. Add 200 µl of DMMB to each sample and shake the plate of a plate shaker for 5 sec. Read the absorbance using a plate reader at 525 nm immediately.

        "@value": "Co-immunoprecipitation in Yeast. This protocol describes investigation of protein-protein interactions in baker yeast by co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP). CoIP is a technique to identify physiologically relevant protein-protein interactions in the cell. The interesting protein can be isolated out of solution using antibody that specifically binds to that particular protein (antigene protein). The partner proteins that are bound to a specific target protein can be co-immunoprecipitated together with an antigen. These protein complexes can then be analyzed to identify new binding partners, binding affinities, the kinetics of binding and the function of the target protein. Here I describe the protocols that allow to immunoprecipitate different protein complexes, for example NAC complex (Panasenko et al., 2009), Ccr4-Not complex (Panasenko and Collort, 2011), ribosomes (Panasenko and Collort, 2012) and investigate their partners. For each CoIP I used the different lysis buffer, as indicated below in recipes.. Nascent associated complex (NAC) and Ccr4-Not complex IP Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 4，000 x g. Wash the cells with 1 ml of sterile H2O and transfer to the eppendorf tube. Cells can be stored at -20 °C. Work on ice! Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, add 0.5 ml of glass beads and disrupt 15 min on the glass bead beater at 4 °C. Transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Wash the beads with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Combine all liquid phases. To avoid the contamination with cells derby preclean the total extracts. For this transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Centrifuge 1 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into the new eppendorf tube and centrifuge 20 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Measure the total protein concentrations in the supernatants [= TE (Total Extracts)]. For this dilute the total extracts 1: 20 and load 5 and 10 μl to the Bradford sample (0.8 ml of water and 0.2 ml of Bradford reactive). Use Protein-A or Protein-G beads 20 μl of 100% beads per reaction. Wash the beads for 20 sec 2 times with 1 ml of water and 1 time with 1 ml of lysis buffer, after each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min. Resuspend till 20% in lysis buffer. Take 100 μl of this suspension per reaction. Mix 0.4 ml of the total extracts containing 2 mg of total protein (5 mg/ml) with 100 μl of beads suspension and 1-2 μl of antibodies. Incubate from 4 h till over night at 4 °C with mild rotation. Wash the beads for 20 sec with 1 ml of lysis buffer 3 times, after each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min. Add 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer 2x to the beads and incubate 10 min at 65 °C. Analyze the CoIP by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Load the total extracts (30 μg) and immunoprecipitated fraction (20 μl) on the gel. Notes: For the control there are 2 possibilities. Use the total extracts from the strains lacking the immunoprecipitated antigen. Use the same total extract that you use for IP but do not add the antibodies. Ribosome IP During the cyclic process of translation, a small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunit associate with mRNA to form an 80S complex (monosome). This ribosome moves along the mRNA during translation. Further ribosomes can initiate translation on the same mRNA to form polysomes. It is possible to immunoprecipitate separate ribosome particles (40S or 60S) or polysomes. To disrupt the polysomes, 25 mM of EDTA is added to the buffers. To maintain the polysomes, 0.1 mg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) is added to the culture before collection and to all the solution. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD or selective media. In the morning dilute night culture till OD600 = 0.15. Grow 100 ml of culture at 30 °C until OD600 = 0.6-0.8. To keep the polysomes add cycloheximide (CHX) till final concentration 0.1 mg/ml and incubate 10 min on ice. To disrupt the polysomes avoid this step. To keep the polysomes spin the cells for 5 min at 4,000 x g and wash with 50 ml of cold water containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX. To disrupt the polysomes wash with 50 ml of cold water without CHX. Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of CHX (in case of polysomes), spin. Cells can be frozen and stored at -20 °C. Transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Wash the beads with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Combine all liquid phases. To avoid the contamination with cells derby preclean the total extracts. For this transfer the liquid phase into the new tube. Centrifuge 1 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into the new eppendorf tube and centrifuge 20 min 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Measure the total protein concentrations in the supernatants [= TE (total extracts)]. For this dilute the total extracts 1: 20 and load 5 and 10 μl to the Bradford sample (0.8 ml of water and 0.2 ml of Bradford reactive). Use Protein-A or Protein-G beads 20 μl of 100% beads per reaction. Wash the beads for 20 sec 2 times with 1 ml of water and 1 time with 1 ml of lysis buffer, after each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min. Take 100 μl of this suspension per reaction. Mix 0.4 ml of the total extracts containing 2 mg of total protein (5 mg/ml) with 100 μl of beads suspension and 1-2 μl of antibodies. Incubate from 2-4 h at 4 °C with mild rotation. Wash the beads for 20 sec with 1 ml of lysis buffer, containing 0.5 % of Triton X-100, 3 times. After each washing spin the beads at 800 x g for 1 min. Add 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer 2x to the beads and incubate 10 min at 65 °C. Analyze the CoIP by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Load the total extracts (30 μg) and immunoprecipitated fraction (20 μl) on the gel. Notes: For the control there are 2 possibilities. Use the total extracts from the strains lacking the immunoprecipitated antigen. Use the same total extract that you use for IP but do not add the antibodies.."

        "@value": "RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis. The northern blot is a technique used in molecular biology research to study gene expression by detection of RNA in a sample. With northern blotting it is possible to observe particular gene expression levels during differentiation, morphogenesis, as well as abnormal or diseased conditions. Here, we examine ATF3, ATF4, and GADD153 gene expression profiles by northern blot in Vero cells and H1299 cells after IBV infection. RNA was extracted in IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) infected cells and electrophoresis was used to separate the RNA sample. RNA was transferred from the electrophoresis gel to the blotting membrane by capillary transfer. Specific mRNA was detected with hybridization probes complementary to part of target sequence. The probes were prepared by RT-PCR and labeled by digoxigenin (DIG) using DIG labeling kit.. RNA extraction Cells were seeded in 100-mm-diameter dishes and infected with either 2 PFU of live IBV per cell or the same amount of UV-inactivated IBV (UV-IBV) at 37 °C. Excess virus in the medium was removed by replacing with fresh medium at 1 h post-infection. The IBV-infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At the indicated time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 h post-infection), cells were rinsed with 10 ml Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) buffer once and lysed in 1 ml TRIzol for 5 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were transfer into eppendorf tubes and one-fifth (volume/volume) of chloroform was added to each tube. Shake tubes vigorously by hand for 15 sec and incubated for 3 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was transfer into a new tube and mixed with 1:1 (volume/volume) of 100% isopropanol, and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml 70% RNase-free ethanol once and spin down by 7,500 x g for 5 min. The RNA pellets are air-dried and dissolved in 100 µl RNase-free H2O by incubating at 65 °C for 15 min. RNA concentration and purity were determined by NanoDrop. The RNAs were stored at -80 °C for further use. Probe preparation Northern blot probes were obtained by RT-PCR and labeled by digoxigenin (DIG) using DIG labeling kit described as follow steps. 2 µg of total RNA is added to 2 µl of 10 pmoles of an oligo (dT) in a sterile 0.2 ml thin-wall Gene-Amp PCR tube of a final volume of 10.5 µl. After denaturation at 65 °C for 10 min, the tubes are cooled on ice immediately. The denatured RNA-primer mixture is then added to a final volume of 20 µl reaction mixture containing 10 mM of dNTPs, 20 units of Rnasinâ ribonuclease inhibitor, 1x Expandä reverse transcriptase buffer and 50 units of reverse transcriptase. The first strand cDNA is synthesized at 43 °C for 1 h, and reaction can be terminated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min (optional). Amplification of cDNA was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a 25 or 50 µl reactions containing of appropriate primer pairs and PFU polymerase using the DIG labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s manual. Primers used for human ATF4 were 5’-CCGTCCCAAACCTTACGATC-3’ (forward) and 5’-ACTATCCTCAACTAGGGGAC-3’ (reverse). Primers used for human ATF3 were 5’-GGTTAGGACTCTCCACTCAA-3 (forward) and 5’-AGACAGTAGCCAGCGTCCTT-3’ (reverse). Primers used for human GADD153 were 5'-GATTCCAGTCAGAGCTCCCT3' (forward) and 5'-GTAGTGTGGCCCAAGTGGGG-3' (reverse). Prepare a 10x concentration solution of each respective PCR primer. Add the following reagents in a 0.2 ml reaction tube on ice, in the following order: ddH2O 32.25 µl, PCR buffer 5 µl, PCR DIG labeling mix 5 µl, forward primer 5 µl, reverse primer 5 µl, enzyme mix 0.75 µl, template cDNA 2 µl, final volume 50 µl. Vortex the mixture and centrifuge briefly. Place the sample in a thermal block cycler and perform PCR in following condition: initial denature at 95 °C for 2 min, denature at 95 °C for 10 sec, anneal at 60 °C for 30 sec, and elongate at 72 °C for 2 min, repeat denaturation, annealing, and elongation for 30 cycles, finally elongate at 72 °C for 7 min. Run a portion of each PCR reaction on an agarose mini gel and then stain the gel with ethidium bromide and examine the PCR products under UV. Northern blot To analyze RNA expression by Northern blot, 30 µg of RNA from each sample preparation was mixed with RNA loading buffer and load on wells in 1.3% agarose formaldehyde gel (see Recipes). Run the gel with 3-4 V/cm in RNase free gel boxes for 4 h until the RNAs are well separated. Stain the gel briefly in 0.25 – 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide and examine the gel under UV light. Rinse gels for 2 x 15 min in 20x SSC and RNA on the gel were transferred onto a HybondTM-N+ membrane by capillary transfer with 20x SSC overnight at room temperature. Fix the RNA to the membrane by UV-crosslinking. The energy used is 20,000 µJoules/cm2 at 245 nm. After the UV-crosslinking, rinse the membranes briefly in ddH2O and allow to air-dry. Prehybridize membranes with DIG easy Hyb for 30 min with gentle agitation at 68 °C. Denature DIG-labeled RNA probes by boiling for 5 min and rapidly cooling in ice, and add the denatured probes (25 ng/ml) to 10 ml prewarmed DIG Easy Hyb. 10 ml probe/hybridization mixtures were added to membranes and incubated for 6 h at 68 °C with gentle agitation. After hybridization, membranes were washed with 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 x 5 min at 25 °C under constant agitation, and then washed with 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 x 15 min at 68 °C under constant agitation. The membranes were then rinsed briefly (5 min) in washing buffer and was blocked in blocking buffer for 30 min. After blocking, membranes were incubated with DIG antibody (Dilute anti-DIG-AP 1:10,000 in blocking buffer) for 30 min, washed 2 x 15 min in washing buffer and equilibrated 3 min in detection buffer. The signal was detected with CDP-Star according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Figures 1-3). Figure 1. Northern blot analysis of ATF4 mRNA in IBV-infected cells. Vero and H1299 cells were infected with IBV (MOI~1) and harvested at indicated time points. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot using an ATF4 probe. Ethidium bromide staining of 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA is shown as a loading control. Band intensities of ATF4 were determined and normalized to rRNA. Figure 2. Northern blot analysis of ATF3 mRNA in IBV-infected cells. Vero and H1299 cells were infected as in Figure 1. RNA extraction and Northern blot was performed as in Figure 1 using ATF3 probe. Figure 3. Northern blot analysis of GADD153 at the mRNA level in IBV-infected cells. Vero and H1299 cells were infected with IBV (MOI~1) or incubated with UV-IBV and harvested at indicated time points. RNA extraction and Northern blot was performed as in Figure 1 using GADD153 probe.."

        "@value": "Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay for Antifungal Drugs. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay is widely used to measure the susceptibility of yeasts to antifungal agents. In serial two-fold dilutions, the lowest concentration of antifungal drug that is sufficient to inhibit fungal growth is the MIC. Typically, 50% inhibitory (MIC50) or 80% inhibitory (MIC80) values are reported. To facilitate visualization of antifungal susceptibility data, heat maps are generated whereby optical density values are represented quantitatively with colour.. Grow an overnight culture of the strains to be assayed, including relevant controls, in 3 ml of the appropriate medium being tested. Prepare the MIC plate with the drug gradient to be tested. Always set up the plates in duplicate. Add 100 µl of the medium to all 96 wells except for column 12 using a multi-channel pipette. To column 12, add 200 µl of the medium that contains drug at 2x the final concentration that the titration will start at. Perform 2-fold dilutions by transferring 100 µl of the drug-containing medium from column 12 to column 11 (mix well and repeat across the row). Stop at column 2 and discard the excess 100 µl so that column 1 is the drug-free control. Measure the OD600 of 100 µl of the overnight cultures in duplicates in a 96 well plate. Subtract the OD600 reading from medium only wells to account for background. Calculate the average OD600 for each strain. To prepare the inoculum in 5 ml of medium, add 1/OD600 x 1.5 µl of the overnight culture. Add 100 µl of diluted inoculum (~103 cells) to every well from columns 1 to 12, one strain per row. Incubate the plates statically at the appropriate temperature (35 °C is the standard temperature approved by CLSI standard, 37 °C is a clinically relevant temperature, and 30 °C is a commonly used laboratory temperature) for the desired amount of time, often for 24, 48, or 72 h. To prepare plates for OD600 reading, mix wells with a multi-channel pipette. Process the data in Excel. Copy OD600 values for each drug replicate into a new worksheet. Above the first row of values, label the drug gradient with the appropriate concentration for each column. Label the strains in the left-most column. Calculate the average of medium-only values and subtract it from all values on the plate. Convert any negative numbers to “0”. Calculate the average of values from each duplicate. Optional: To normalize growth in the drug gradient relative to its drug-free control, divide the OD600 values of each well by the OD600 value of the well in the column 1 of the corresponding row. Copy the referenced values to a new worksheet using “paste special”, select “values only” and arrange in the following format. Note: This data was updated by authors on Oct. 15, 2015. Save as a text (tab delimited) file. Plot the data as heat map in JavaTree View. Open the text (tab delimited) file in JavaTree View.å. Under setting, make the following changes in pixel. Zoom X: Fixed Scale = 60 Zoom Y: Fixed Scale = 60 Contrast Value: 1 Positive: 102, 204, 0 (Green) Export the file The above figure is adapted from Reference 2, and plotted based on the data shown in the table associated with point 8 g above. Growth measured by optical density is quantitatively displayed with color as indicated in the color bar, such that bright green represents full growth and black represents no growth. As indicated above, growth of each strain can be plotted as values normalized to the drug-free control for the same strain, or growth can be directly plotted without normalization.."

        "@value": "Scratch Wound Healing Assay. The scratch wound healing assay has been widely adapted and modified to study the effects of a variety of experimental conditions, for instance, gene knockdown or chemical exposure, on mammalian cell migration and proliferation. In a typical scratch wound healing assay, a “wound gap” in a cell monolayer is created by scratching, and the “healing” of this gap by cell migration and growth towards the center of the gap is monitored and often quantitated. Factors that alter the motility and/or growth of the cells can lead to increased or decreased rate of “healing” of the gap (Lampugnani, 1999). This assay is simple, inexpensive, and experimental conditions can be easily adjusted for different purposes. The assay can also be used for a high-throughput screen platform if an automated system is used (Yarrow and Perlman, 2004).. Grow cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Seed cells into 24-well tissue culture plate at a density that after 24 h of growth, they should reach ~70-80% confluence as a monolayer. Do not change the medium. Gently and slowly scratch the monolayer with a new 1 ml pipette tip across the center of the well. While scratching across the surface of the well, the long-axial of the tip should always be perpendicular to the bottom of the well. The resulting gap distance therefore equals to the outer diameter of the end of the tip. The gap distance can be adjusted by using different types of tips. Scratch a straight line in one direction. Scratch another straight line perpendicular to the first line to create a cross in each well. After scratching, gently wash the well twice with medium to remove the detached cells. Replenish the well with fresh medium. Note: Medium may contain ingredients of interest that you want to test, e.g., chemicals that inhibit/promote cell motility and/or proliferation. Grow cells for additional 48 h (or the time required if different cells are used). Wash the cells twice with 1x PBS, then fix the cells with 3.7% paraformaldehye for 30 min. Stain the fixed cells with 1% crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 30 min. Take photos for the stained monolayer on a microscope. Set the same configurations of the microscope when taking pictures for different views of the stained monolayer. The gap distance can be quantitatively evaluated using software such as Photoshop or ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html). To reduce variability in results, it’s suggested that multiple views of each well should be documented, and each experimental group should be repeated multiple times.."

        "@value": "Visualization of Nitric Oxide, Measurement of Nitrosothiols Content, Activity of NOS and NR in Wheat Seedlings. Nitric oxide (NO), is a redox-active, endogenous signalling molecule involved in the regulation of numerous processes. It plays a crucial role in adaptation and tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses. In higher plants, NO is produced either by enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitrite and an oxidative pathway requiring a putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme. There are several methods to measure NO production: mass spectrometry, tissue localization by DAF-FM dye. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) also known as electron spin resonance (ESR) and spectrophotometric assays. The activity of NOS can be measured by L-citrulline based assay and spectroscopic method (NADPH utilization method). A major route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This experimental method describes visualization of NO using DAF-FM dye by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss AXIOSKOP 2). The whole procedure is simplified, so it is easy to perform but has a high sensitivity for NO detection. In addition, spectrophotometry based protocols for assay of NOS, Nitrate Reductase (NR) and the content of S-nitrosothiols are also described. These spectrophotometric protocols are easy to perform, less expensive and sufficiently sensitive assays which provide adequate information on NO based regulation of physiological processes depending on the treatments of interest.. Plant growth Pre-soak the wheat seeds in Petri plates lined with moist filter paper till they germinate for 5 days. Transfer the uniforms seedlings to 50 ml culture tubes containing nitrogen-free Hoagland solution (Recipe 1). Replenish the Hoagland solution every 3 days (Figure 1). The whole experiment was laid out at National Phytotron Facility, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi in growth chambers (Model PGW 36, Conviron, Winnipeg, Canada). Growth condition: Temperature: 25 °C/18 °C (day/night) Photoperiod: 14 h N/10 h D Photon flux density: 500 µmol m-2 s-1 (PAR) Relative humidity (RH): 90% CO2 concentration: (i) 400 ± 50 µl/l as ambient CO2 (AC) n(ii) 750 ± 50 µl/l as elevated CO2 (EC) Treatments After 10 days of transfer, replenish the culture tubes with different set of treatments as mentioned in Table 1. Maintain 3 replication for each treatment. Cover the mouth of test tubes with aluminum foil to avoid effect of volatile chemicals on neighbouring plants (Figure 1). Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a source of NO; cPTIO, an effective NO scavenger-NAME an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, and Na-Tungstate, an inhibitor of NR can be used to understand the impact of No on regulation of NR activity. Detailed description on impact of EC on NO localization and NR activity in combination with SNP and inhibitors are discussed in Adavi and Sathee (2019). Table 1. Treatment details Figure 1. Representative image of plants grown in 50 ml culture tubes. Each treatment consisted of three tubes with 2 plants per tube. Visualization of NO using fluorescent microscope After 4 h of treatment, harvest the plants. Cut the root tips into small pieces measuring approximately 2 mm using surgical blade. Then immerse the root sections in the Diaminofluorescein-FM dye (5 µM DAF-FM in 20 mM HEPES-KOH with pH 7.5) in a watch glass for 30 min. After 30 min, carefully take out the root sections and wash with HEPES-KOH buffer without dye 2-3 times till the excess dye is removed. Transfer the root sections into glass slide carefully with help of paint brush and cover with cover glass. Drain out excess buffer with help of Kim Wipes. Visualize the slides under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AXIOSKOP 2) at 495 nm excitation and 515 nm emission wavelengths and acquire the images (Figure 2). Analyze the image and calculate the relative fluorescence with “Image J,” a Java-based image processing program. Set scale bar on the image using “Image J”. Figure 2. Representative image of nitric oxide visualized in wheat roots under fluorescent microscope Estimation of Nitrate Reductase (NR) activity Follow the same procedure for plant growth and treatments as mentioned (Procedures A and B) above. Harvest the plants after 4 h of treatment. Estimate in vivo nitrate reductase activity by estimating nitrite formed by the enzyme present in cells and nitrite formed is then diazotized using sulphanilamide in acidic medium and NEDD using the method described by Klepper et al. (1971) and modified by Nair and Abrol (1973). Estimate the nitrite amount using Evans and Nason method (1953). Harvest the plants and store in labeled butter paper bags and keep on ice until weighing. Cut the samples (leaves and roots) into 2 mm pieces and mix thoroughly, weigh 0.3 g and add to ice cold incubation medium containing 3 ml each of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.5) and potassium nitrate solution (0.4 M). To this, add 0.2 ml of n-propanol. Vacuum infiltrate the samples using a pump for 2 min (80-85KPa) and then incubate in a water bath at 30 °C for 30 min under dark conditions. After incubation, place the tubes in a water bath (70-80 °C) for 3-4 min to stop the enzyme activity and for the complete leaching of nitrite into the medium. Estimate the amount of nitrite produced by taking adequate amount of aliquot (0.2 ml) in a test tube; to it add 1 ml of sulphanilamide (1% in 1 N HCI). After mixing, add 1 ml NEDD (0.02%) and again mix well. Pink color is formed immediately, and after 20 min make the total volume up to 3 ml with double distilled water. Measure the absorbance using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (model Specord Bio-200) at 540 nm. Prepare the calibration curve using standard potassium nitrite solution. Express the enzyme activity as µmol nitrite formed g-1 DW h-1. Estimation of Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity Follow the same procedure for plant growth and treatments as mentioned (Procedures A and B) above. Harvest the plants after 4 h of treatment. Homogenize 0.5 g of tissue (leaf and root) samples in 5 ml of cold extraction buffer in pre-chilled mortar and pestle. Centrifuge the homogenate at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C (Hageman and Hucklesby, 1971). Collect the supernatant to carry out enzyme assays. Determine the protein content of the supernatant by following Bradford’ method (1976). Determine the activity of NOS in the reaction mixture (Gonzalez et al., 2012) containing assay buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0), 1 mM L-Arginine, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 4 μM BH4, 1 μM FAD, 1 μM FMN, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM NADPH with 100 μl of tissue extract. Observe the change in absorbance due to NADPH utilization at 340 nm for 1 min. Reference was set using reaction mixtures containing distilled water instead of enzyme extract. Three replications of positive control with reaction mixture without L-Arginine was also maintained in each treatment. Use the extinction coefficient of NADPH (ε = 6.22 mM-1 cm-1) for calculating NOS activity. Estimation of S-nitrosothiols Formation of S-nitrosothiols is estimated from leaf and root tissues (Arc et al., 2013). All the steps need to be performed in dark condition. Follow the same procedure for plant growth and treatments as mentioned (Procedures A and B) above. Homogenize 0.5 g of tissue (leaf and root) samples in 5 ml of cold s-nitrosothiols extraction buffer (Recipe 3) in pre-chilled mortar and pestle. Centrifuge the extract at 13,800 x g for 25 min at 4 °C. Mix the supernatant with 50 µl ammonium sulfonate and incubate at room temperature for 2 min. Then add 0.3 ml each of sulfanilamide, HgCl2 and NEDD to the reaction mixture. Keep the reaction mixture under dark condition for 20 min at 30 °C. Measure the absorbance using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (model Specord Bio-200) at 540 nm.. Nitric oxide (NO) is emerging as a key regulator of diverse plant cellular processes like regulating synthesis of the cell wall (Correa-Aragunde et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2015), ROS metabolism in plants (Delledonne et al., 2001), gene expression and regulation (Bogdan et al., 2000), programmed cell death (de Pinto et al., 2002), maturation and senescence (Yaacov et al., 1998). NO exerts a crucial role in protecting plants against various abiotic stresses (Hung et al., 2002). NO could significantly enhance antioxidative capacity by increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and accumulating proline during wheat seed germination under osmotic stress (Zhang et al., 2003). A major route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). Total cellular levels of protein S-nitrosylation are controlled predominantly by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (GSNOR1) which turns over the natural NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In the absence of GSNOR1 function, GSNO accumulates, leading to dysregulation of total cellular S-nitrosylation (Yun et al., 2016)Nitric oxide (NO) production in land plants classically involves two main routes: first, a reductive pathway involving both enzymatic and non-enzymatic reduction of nitrite into NO (Gupta et al., 2011); second, an oxidative pathway requiring a putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme. Role of NR in NO production was suspected by low or no NR activity mutants which show no measurable NO. Later nia1/nia2 double mutants of Arabidopsis confirmed the role of NR in reduction of NO2- to NO in NADH dependent manner under both in vitro (Yamasaki et al., 1999) and in vivo (Vanin et al., 2004) condition. The possibility that NOS could catalyze NO synthesis in plants has also been a main controversial issue. Experimental evidence further increased suspicion about the existence of a plant NOS-like enzyme. It was reported that the L-citrulline based assay commonly used to measure a NOS activity in plant extracts is prone to artefacts (Tischner et al., 2007). Several methods have been reported for nitric oxide assay in plants which includes gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Neil et al., 2003; Conarth et al., 2004, Bethke et al., 2004), laser photo-acoustic spectroscopy (Lesham and Pinchasov, 2000), NO electrode (Yamasaki et al., 2001), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Sun et al., 2018) and a group of florescent dye indicators which are available in acetylated form for intracellular measurements like Diaminofluorescein-FM (DAF-FM) (Du et al., 2016). Fluorescent dye indicator and EPR both are highly specific for NO. EPR is limited by inability to detect low level NO production and insolubility of chelating agent. Use of fluorogenic probe DAF-FM is gaining more importance because of their simplicity, high sensitivity towards NO and are essentially independent of pH above pH 5.5. This probe is membrane-permeant and deacylated by intracellular esterases to 4-amino-5-methylamino-2 V, 7 V-difluorofluorescein. Presence of light leads to autoxidation of Diaminofluorescein-FM (DAF-FM) dye and simultaneous presence of NO and superoxide source (like xanthine + xanthine oxidase) decreases the fluorescence of Diaminofluorescein-FM (DAF-FM), resulting in underestimation of nitric oxide production (Balcerczyk et al., 2005). This limits the use of Diaminofluorescein-FM (DAF-FM) in stress-related study.The activity of NOS can be measured by L-citrulline based assay (Tischner et al., 2007) and spectroscopic method (NADPH utilization method) ( Gonzalez et al., 2012). Citrulline-based assay measures the formation of L-citrulline from L-arginine using ion exchange chromatography. The assay does not exactly quantify citrulline; any arginine derivative that does not bind to the cation exchange resin will give a signal and leads to false measurement and also involve radiolabelling which may be tedious to handle (Tischner et al., 2007). Spectrophotometric measurement of NOS activity has been widely regarded as a less expensive and sufficiently sensitive assay for routine laboratorial experiments.Nitrate reductase activity can be measured by an in vitro or an easy to perform in vivo method (Nair and Abrol, 1973). We have used these protocols to study the effect of elevated CO2 (EC) and nitrate supply on nitrogen metabolism in wheat seedlings (Adavi and Sathee, 2019). S-nitrosylation of NR by EC induced NO produced in plants supplied with high nitrate concentration decreases the enzyme activity (Cheng et al., 2015; Du et al., 2016)."

        "@value": "Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation to Hematopoietic Precursors. Embryonic stem cells are derived from inner cell mass of an embryo that can differentiate into every cell type in the body. Clinically, cultured red blood cell supply is of great interest. However, some of the hurdles need to be overcome. This protocol describes a two step protocol to form embryoid body and differentiate them in to hematopoietic lineage cells, especially erythroid cells.. Primary differentiation of ES cells (making Embryoid Bodies) Two days prior to setting up differentiation, split cells into ES-IMDM medium without feeder cells in gelatinized T25 flask (this dilutes out most of the STO cells). Add 4 x 105 ES cells per T25 flask. Change medium the next day (ES cells grow faster therefore use up nutrients faster; doubles every 8 h). Set up differentiation as follows. Aspirate medium from the flask. Add 1 ml of trypsin/EDTA, swirl around, and quickly remove. Add 1 ml of trypsin/EDTA and wait until cells start to detach. It usually takes about 1-2 min. Do not over-trypsinize cells. Deactivate the trypsin by adding 1 ml FCS (differentiation serum) and 4 ml IMDM and pipette up and down to make single cell suspensions. It is important not to have cell clumps. Transfer to 15 ml snap cap tube. Centrifuge for 5-10 min at 1,000 rpm. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml IMDM (w/o FCS; this removes LIF and any other factors that might interfere with differentiation). Spin down cells for 5-10 min at 1,000 rpm. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml IMDM (w/ differentiation serum) and count the VIABLE ES cell number using eosin (0.2% eosin in 1× PBS). Make sure to count ES cells only. Add 5,000-6,000 ES cells/ml of differentiation media for day 2.75-3 EBs. For ChIP purpose, I prepared 8-10 dishes and prepared enough media for one extra dish. Add 4,000-5,000 cells/ml for day 4-5 EBs. Add 500-2,000 cells/ml for day 6-10 EBs. Add more cells (7-8,000 cells/ml for day 2.75-3 EBs) if they differentiate poorly. Too many cells could result in poor differentiation of EBs. You don’t want the cells to use up the nutrients before they reach the certain days. Primary differentiation to derive EBs is typically done in 10 ml/10 cm dish. Use bacterial petri dish (Valmark (good), Fisher (poor) VWR (not recommended)). Do not use tissue culture dishes because all the cells will adhere and will not form EBs. If you have a way to constantly shake your dish in the incubator this improves efficiency, otherwise shake your dish 2-3 times a day until the EBs are ready. Hematopoietic precursor analysis (secondary differentiation) Embryoid body (EB) harvest. EBs in liquid: Transfer media containing EBs into 50 ml tubes. Wash the dish with IMDM and pool. Let it sit at room temperature (RT) for about 10-20 min. EBs will settle down to the bottom of the tube. EBs in methylcellulose: Add equal volume of cellulase (2 units/ml, final 1 unit/ml) and incubate 20 min at 37 °C. Collect EBs in 50 ml tubes. Wash the dish with IMDM. Let it sit at RT for about 5-10 min. EBs will settle down to the bottom of the tube. While the EBs are settling down prepare replating media enough for one extra plate (if you need 10 plates prepare media for 11 plates) look at the recipe for details. Aspirate off as much media as possible minimizing the EB loss, add 3 ml trypsin and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C (use water bath). Very important to keep the time. It is directly related with survival and differentiation potential of ES cells. If you are harvesting for FACS analysis, 7.5 mM EDTA should be used to dissociate the EBs. This is more harsh treatment, however, receptors are kept intact. Quickly vortex briefly and add 1 ml FCS (differentiation serum). Dissociate by passing 8-10 times through a 20 gauge needle. Transfer to 15 ml tube and spin for 5-10 min at 1,000 rpm. Use collagenase for older EBs (i.e. >day 9). When collagenase is used, incubate cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Resuspend the pellet in 0.3-1 ml of IMDM (w/ 10% FCS). Smaller the volume the better. Count the viable cells. At this point, there should be no cell clumps. Add EBs to methylcellulose replating media. Shake well and let it sit for few minutes for bubbles to rise up. Using the 16 gauge blunt-end needle dispence the media+EBs on to appropriate dishes (you can use any bacterial dish for this). Always prepare bit more than what you need. Methylcellulose is sticky. Small scale differentiation: Add 3-6 x 104 EBs ml-1 of methylcellulose replating media. Add 1.25 ml methylcellulose mix to each 35 mm bacterial dishes for blast colony assay. Otherwise, add 1 ml each. Prepare three replica dishes for each sample, i.e. make 4.5 ml methylcellulose replating media for blast colony assay and make 4 ml methylcellulose replating media for erythroid and other myeloid colony assay. For ChIP: Add 1-1.5 x 105 EBs/ml of methylcellulose replating media. Add 10 ml methylcellulose mix to each 10 cm dishes. 10 x 10 cm plates will yield enough cells for 4 IPs (8-10 x 107). Place the plates in 245 mm square dish and a small 35 mm dish with water to maintain the humidity. This prevents the gel from drying up and cracking. Harvest Prepare celluase + PBS solution (2 μg/ml) Add same volume of cellulase solution to each plate so the final concentration of cellalase is 1 μg/ml. Incubate at 37 °C for 30-40 min until methocell is watery. Scrape plates and collect cells in 50 ml Falcon tube. Vortex and spin at 1,000 rpm, 5 min. Wash with fresh media or PBS and spin at 1,000 rpm, 5 min.."

        "@value": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Lung Tissue Digestion. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a simple but valuable and typically performed technique commonly used for studying the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as asthma and COPD. Cell counts can be combined with new methods for examining inflammatory responses, such as ELISA, Flow cytometric analysis, immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and HPLC to assess cellular expression for inflammatory cytokines and growth factor. Here we describe a basic procedure to collect BAL fluid and digest lung tissue for assessing a number of pulmonary components.. Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml 2.5% Avertin in PBS. Using scissors to expose thoracic cage and neck. Dissect tissue from neck to expose trachea. Proceed to open the diaphragm by cutting the rib cage to expose both the heart and lungs. Take caution not to pierce heart or lungs. Use forceps to slide 1 inch long piece of thread underneath trachea. Make a small incision in the trachea, to allow passage of 21 gauge lavage tube into trachea. The distance between the proximal end of the trachea and the tracheal incision is 2-3 mm. Note: Do not cut trachea all the way through. Cut a 1-1.5 inch segment of 21 gauge tube, carefully pass a 21 gauge needle into the tubing. Insert tubing into trachea and tie thread into single knot around tubing in trachea. Slowly inject 1 ml cold PBS with 0.1 mM EDTA into lungs using “input” 3 ml syringe via 3-way stopcocks: Watch lungs inflating and do not overinflate. Collect ~1 ml BAL fluid (BALF) from lungs using “output” 3 ml syringe into microtubes on ice. Repeat steps 7-8 for 3 washes per animal, each using 1 ml PBS/0.1 mM EDTA through 3-way stopcocks. Remove syringe from needle, inject recovered lavage fluid to 15 ml falcon tube on ice. Note: For lung tissue digestion, please go to step 22. Centrifuge microtubes containing ~1 ml BAL at 1,500 rpm for 5 min with brake. Pipet supernatant (BALF) from these tubes into fresh microtubes, store at -80 °C until ready to perform ELISA. Pipet 500 μl PBS to resuspend cell pellet in centrifuged microtubes and add all cells back into 15 ml conical tubes. Centrifuge 15 ml conical tubes at 1,500 rpm for 5 min with brake and resuspend cells with 1 ml erythrocyte lysis buffer and keep on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge the cells at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Discard supernatant and resuspend BAL cells in 500 μl RPMI or FACS buffer. Add 50 μl of trypan blue to 50 μl saved aliquot, mix well and count cells using a hemocytometer. Calculate and record cell concentration. Note: Dark blue cells are dead and should not be counted. Compute volume needed for 0.5-1 x 105 cells for each slide. Pre-wet cytospin funnels by spinning with 300 μl PBS onto glass slides (reusable) at 600 rpm for 5 min. Prepare microtubes containing 0.5-1 x 105 cells in 300 μl total volume. Spin BAL cells onto fresh labeled glass slides at 600 rpm for 10 min. Remove all slides from the cytospin apparatus, and allow to air dry at least 2 h. After dry, stain slides using Diff-Quick stain kit as follows: 25 sec in fixative solution 15 sec in solution I 15 sec in solution II rinse the slide in distilled water. Perform differential cell counts under microscope at 100x magnification using oil-immersion lens (Figure 1). Figure 1. Photograph of cytospun BAL cells stained with Diff-Quick. (A) Control BAL; (B) BAL from asthmatic mice. The following protocol is for lung tissue digestion. Immediately after lavage, perfuse the lung vascular bed using a 10 ml syringe filled with 5 ml PBS. Make a small incision in the left ventricle and connect a 21 G needle and insert needle into the right ventricle. Accurate perfusion will result in a color change to white. Transfer lung lobes to a petri dish and chop it to small digestible pieces using a razor blade. Transfer grounded lung tissue into a 50 ml flask containing 20 ml/lung of tissue digestion solution and magnetic stir bar. Incubate, stirring at regular speed, at 37 °C for 30-45 min. Note: This can be performed in 37 °C incubator. Disperse the suspension by repeated aspiration through a 10 ml syringe, transfer to a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500 rpm at 4 °C. Lyse remaining erythrocytes by suspension in erythrocyte lysis buffer for 2 min at room temperature. Wash cells with 10 ml cold PBS/0.5% BSA and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500 rpm at 4 °C. Wash cells twice with 10 ml cold PBS/0.5% BSA, and filter through a 100-μm cell strainer. Resuspend 1 millions cells in 50 μl of 1:200 Fc block in FACS buffer and incubate for 10 min on ice. Wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS/0.5% BSA and spin down the cells for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and stain cells with antibodies (1:100 in FACS buffer) and incubate for 30 min on ice. Note: All the fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs were purchased from eBioscience or Biolegend. Wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS/0.5% BSA and spin down the cells for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the cells in 500 μl PBS/0.5% BSA and analyze the cells using BD LSR II flow cytometer (Figure 2). Figure 2. Gating strategy for lung digested cells. This strategy also applies to BAL cells.."

        "@value": "Catalase Activity Assay in Candida glabrata. Commensal and pathogenic fungi are exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by macrophages of the host. Pathogenic fungi counteract the harmful effects of H2O2 with the enzyme catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), which decomposes two molecules of H2O2 to two molecules of H2O and O2. Contribution of antioxidant systems on fungal virulence is actively studied. Measurement of catalase activity can contribute to the elucidation of the factors that influence the regulation of this pivotal enzyme. Here we describe a simple spectrophotometric method in which the activity of catalase is measured in total yeast extracts. Decomposition of H2O2 by the yeast extract is followed by the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm. The difference in absorbance through time (ΔA240) is inferred as the measure of catalase activity.. Preparation of total soluble extracts Yeast strains are grown overnight in 5 ml of Yeast extract-Peptone-Dextrose broth or selective media at 30 °C. Dilute overnight cultures in 50 ml of fresh medium in order that after seven duplications, the yeast cultures reach an OD600 = 0.5 at 30 °C. Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 2,600 x g. Discard supernatant. Temperature of centrifuge is not relevant. Wash the cells with 25 ml of sterile water and discard supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml PB with protease inhibitors and transfer to a microfuge tube. Keep the samples on ice. Add 50 µl of zirconia/silica beads to each sample. Disrupt the cells by vortexing at maximum speed for 1 min and place on ice for another minute. Repeat 20 times. Centrifuge the lysate at 25,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and zirconia/silica beads Transfer supernatant to a clean microfuge tube. At this point, lysates are ready for quantification of total protein and measurement of catalase activity. Alternatively, samples can be stored at -20 °C. Bradford assay for protein quantitation Fill the wells of a microplate with 250 µl of Bradford regent. Prepare a standard curve of absorbance versus nanograms of protein using fresh BSA standards (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 ng/µl). Use PB as solvent. Dilute the lysates 1:20 or 1:50 with sterile water. Load 5 µl of the standards and diluted lysates to the Bradford reagent. Incubate room temperature for 5 min. Measure the absorbance at OD595 in a microplate spectrophotometer. Determine the amount of protein of the samples from the standard curve. Consider the dilution factor. Catalase activity assay Set up the spectrophotometer by first turning on the instrument and then the UV light. Set up a kinetics program to record every 30 s at a wavelength of 240 nm for 2 min. Calibrate the spectrophotometer using 3 ml of PB in a 3-ml quartz cuvette as a blank. Dilute the lysate samples 1:50 with PB. In a quartz cuvette, mix 1 ml PB with 1 ml of the diluted sample. To begin the assay, add 1 ml of the H2O2 solution (H2O2 to a final concentration of 10 mM). The initial absorbance must be between 0.550 and 0.520. If necessary, add H2O2 to increase the absorbance and Phosphate Buffer to decrease the absorbance. Mix the content by inversion and Immediately place the cuvettes into the spectrophotometer. Follow the decrease in absorbance at OD240 with a stopwatch for 2 min. A catalase solution must be used as a control. Pippete 2.9 ml of PB in the cuvette, add 1 ml 30 mM H2O2 and 100 µl of the catalase solution (~10 units). Record the initial and final absorbance in a one-minute period. Use 2 ml of PB and 1 ml of 30 mM H2O2 as blank. Calculate the catalase activity using the following formula (Cuellar-Cruz et al., 2009) Where is the difference between the initial and final absorbance. is the total volume of the reaction (3 ml). is the molar extinction coefficient for H2O2 at OD240 (34.9 mol-1 cm-1). is the optical length path of cuvette (1 cm). is the volume of the sample in ml. is the protein concentration of the sample in mg/ml. Example of catalase activities of extracts from C. glabrata strains in exponential phase of growth: Note: Catalase activity of the BG14 strain is higher in stationary phase ≈ 10 U/mg. However catalase activity of a cta1Δ is always < 2 U/mg or undetectable.."

        "@value": "Whole Spleen Flow Cytometry Assay. In the Whole Spleen Flow Cytometry Assay, we used splenocytes directly ex vivo for stimulation with a variety of TLR ligands. The splenocytes were stimulated for a total of 4 hours, then stained for intracellular cytokines. We then examined cytokine production via flow cytometry. This allowed us to compare the responses of minimally manipulated primary macrophages/monocytes and conventional dendritic cells.. Splenocyte Isolation Extract whole spleen from mouse and place in a 15 ml polypropylene tube on ice (no liquid). Put 5 ml RBC lysis buffer into 15 ml tube with spleen. Pour out spleen with RBC lysis buffer into a 10 cm tissue culture dish. Smash spleen thoroughly between frosted glass slides by placing the spleen on the rough side of the frosted part of the slide (wetted with RBC lysis buffer) and grind it between the two slides until spleen is dissociated (Video 1). Video 1. Homogenization of spleen between two glass slides Pipette up the RBC lysis containing splenocytes back into the 15 ml tube. Add 10 ml of culture medium to the tube, invert 2-3 times. Spin at 1,300 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 ml medium. Filter through a 70 μM filter over a 50 ml conical tube. Count 1:100 dilution of cells. Dilute single-cell suspensions to 1 x 107 cells/ml in RPMI medium (for Flow Assays, counting and calculating of cells is not necessary). Place splenocytes on ice until ready to plate into 96-well plate. Stimulation of splenocytes Prepare a stock of RPMI medium with Brefeldin A added to it at 10 μg/ml. Vortex and spin down all LPS stocks, then sonicate each for 10 min. After sonication, vortex and spin down again. Each stimulus (EC LPS, PA, YP, Lipid IVa) is prepared to twice (2x) its desired final concentration using the Brefeldin A containing medium. Plate 100 μl of each stimulus into the appropriate wells of the 96-well plate, include unstimulated wells as a control. Plate 100 μl of the splenocytes into the appropriate wells (plate an extra set of splenocytes to be used as single stain controls). Incubate the plate for 4 h at 37 °C. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) staining After 4 h, treat wells with 20 μl of 20 mM EDTA. Mix and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Mix again after incubation and then spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate or flick medium off. Block with 100 μl of diluted FcBlock (1:100 FcBlock in PBSA/az) to all wells. Incubate on ice for 15 min. Add 100 μl of PBSA/az, then spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend/stain with 100 μl of Antibody mix: CD11b PerCP-Cy5.5, CD11c PE-Cy7, CD19 APC-Cy7, and CD3 APC (1:100 Ab in PBSA/az) to the stimulated splenocyte samples. Add 100 μl of PBSA/az to the single stain controls, then add 1 μl of each of these single stain Ab: CD8 FITC, CD8 PE, CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5, CD8 PE-Cy7, CD19 APC-Cy7, and CD8 APC. Incubate on ice in dark (or wrap in foil) for 20 min. Add 100 μl PBSA/az, then spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend with 100 μl of BD cytofix/cytoperm solution to all wells. Incubate on ice in dark for 20 min. Add 100 μl of 1x BD Perm wash (dilute 10x Perm wash in dH2O) to all wells. Spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min, then aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend/wash once with 200 μl of 1x BD Perm wash by pipetting up and down a few times to all wells. Spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min, then aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend/stain with 50 μl of Antibody mix: TNF FITC and IL-12/IL-23p40 PE (1:100 Ab in 1x perm wash) to the stimulated splenocyte samples (add 50 μl of 1x perm wash to the single stain controls). Incubate on ice in dark for 30 min. Add 150 μl 1x perm wash to all wells, then spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend/wash once with 200 μl 1x perm wash by pipetting up and down a few times to all wells. Spin at 1,300 rpm for 5 min, then aspirate or flick medium off. Resuspend in final volume of 200 μl of 1% Paraformaldehyde solution (dilute 10% Paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS). Store at 4 °C in dark (or wrapped in foil) until ready for Flow Cytometry (recommended to store no longer than 24 h) – transfer samples from 96-well plate into titer tubes immediately prior to FACS. Flow Cytometry On the BD FACS Canto I software, select for a 'New Experiment' to set up. Select for Area, Height, Width for FSC and SSC; select for Log and Area for the colors FITC, PE, PerCP/Cy5.5, PE/Cy7, APC/Cy7, and APC (under Inspector box). Create compensation controls and adjust the gating for unstained splenocytes (adjust FSC and SSC voltages as necessary). Adjust each color of single stains in the voltage panel so that the positive peak is at the 104 mark. For single stains, use anti-CD4 for PerCP/Cy5.5, anti-CD19 for APC/Cy7, and anti-CD8 for FITC, PE, PE/Cy7, and APC, see Figure 1 for example. Figure 1. Example of single stain controls. Splenocytes were stained with the single antibodies listed under IV-5 and voltages adjusted to give depicted histograms. Record the desired voltages after any adjustments for each of the single stains and unstain, then calculate compensation controls. Events are now ready to be recorded – set up to collect 500,000 – 1,000,000 events.."

        "@value": "Analysis of Mouse Liver Glycogen Content. Liver is the major site for glycogen storage. Glycogen content can be significantly altered upon disruption of glucose homeostasis in metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes. Glycogen content can be determined by an acid-hydrolysis method (Passonneau and Lauderdale, 1974). Basically, glucose, the hydrolysis product of glycogen, is converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by hexokinase in the presence of ATP. With the supply of NADP, G-6-P is further converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid by G-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), while production of NADPH can be measured spectrophotometrically. Our lab has used this method to demonstrate that liver glycogen levels are significantly elevated in diabetic Perk knockout mice (Zhang et al., 2002).. Liver sample preparation Sacrifice non-fasted animals and isolate liver slices. Transfer samples into cryogenic vials, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C before use. Notes: Collect liver samples in the afternoon or during night when animals are well fed. Try to collect samples from around the same region (I typically used the right liver lobe). Record the growth and nutrition status of study subjects (body weight, water consumption, etc). Use the frozen samples within a month (I have never addressed whether degradation of glycogen could occur during long-term storage). For each single sample, prepare 0.5 ml of 2.0 M HCl in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube with locking lid. As the control to measure free glucose, substitute 2.0 M HCl with 2.0 M NaOH. Prepare and label enough tubes with either HCl or NaOH. Heat the tubes in boiling water for ~ 3 to 5 min. Centrifuge briefly, and then wipe the tubes and measure the weights on an analytical balance. Prepare frozen liver samples on dry ice. Transfer ~10 mg to 20 mg samples into the above tubes with hot HCl or NaOH. Measure the weights again on balance. Seal the tubes tightly and boil the samples in water for 1 h. To achieve complete hydrolysis, mince the liver samples within ~5 min with a scissors, and then shake the tubes vigorously every 10 min during the whole process. Cool samples on bench to room temperature (RT) and centrifuge briefly. Reconstitute original weights by adding ddH2O. Neutralize the hydrolysis products with 0.5 ml of 2.0 M NaOH or HCl, accordingly. Vortex samples vigorously and then centrifuge at maximum speed (i.e., ~ 22,000 x g) for 10 min. Glucose level determination - Glucose concentration of the hydrolysis product can be determined using the Glucose (HK) assay reagent. Reconstitute assay reagent with 20 ml ddH2O, and use this reagent within two months. For each single sample, prepare 1 ml assay reagent in an Eppendorf tube, and then add 10 μl supernatant of hydrolysis product. Meanwhile, use 10 μl freshly prepared 0.5 mM beta-D(+)-glucose as the standard, and 10 μl ddH2O as the blank. Incubated at RT for 5 min. Measure absorbance at 340 nm on a Spectra Max 384 spectrophotometer, using a Quartz cuvette. Liver glycogen content is determined as: Abs (sample)/Abs (standard) x Concentration (standard) (i.e., 0.5 mM) x Volume (standard) (i.e., 0.01 ml) x Total volume (i.e., 1.0 ml)/Volume (sample) (i.e., 0.01 ml)/ Weight (sample) (mg) x 1000 Unit = micromoles glucosyl units/ per gram wet liver weight.."

Our lab has used the Alcian blue – Alizarin red staining method with certain modifications to characterize skeleton deformities in mice lacking Pek/Perk, encoding a translational control eIF2alpha kinase.. Adults: Fix mouse skeleton in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 h. Rinse the sample in ddH2O O/N (1 h for embryos) with gentle shaking, and post-fix it in 70% ethanol. Note: At this point, samples can be stored in 70% ethanol for a long period. Remove skins and internal organs carefully from the sample. Note: Remove all skins, even those on the small toes. Stain the sample with 0.02% Alcian blue 8GX (prepared in ethanol/ glacial acetic acid, 7:3) for 1 to 2 days. Note: Cartilage tissues will be stained blue. Wash the sample with plain ethanol/ glacial acetic acid (7:3) for 1 h. Soak the sample in 100% ethanol O/N, and then in ddH2O for 1 to 2 days. Treat the sample with 1.0% trypsin (prepared in water solution containing 30% saturated sodium borate) O/N. Should limp and blue cartilage be readily observed at this point, proceed to stain the sample with Alizarin red (prepared in 0.5% KOH) O/N. Note: Add enough (no specific amount) saturated Alizarin red until the solution appears dark purple. Mineralized bones will be stained red. Treat the sample with a gradient series of 0.5% KOH/ glycerol (i.e., 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 100% glycerol, 2 days for each step), and store it in glycerol with a crystal of thymol. Embryos: A similar protocol can be used to stain embryos. To do this, fix embryos in 90% ethanol for at least 1 week. Treat the sample with 0.01% Alcian blue 8GX for 3 days, and then perform rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol (70% ethanol, 2 to 3 h, twice; 40% ethanol, 2 to 3 h; 15% ethanol, 2 to 3 h; ddH2O, until the sample sinks to the bottom of a conical tube). Treat the sample further with fresh 1% KOH for 1 to 2 days until it becomes clear. Treat the sample with 0.001% Alizarin red for 2 to 3 days until the bone becomes purple. Rinse the sample ~ 3 times in 1% KOH, several hours each time. Treat the sample through a gradient series of glycerol-KOH (20% glycerol/ 1% KOH, 24 h; 50% glycerol/ 1% KOH, 24 h; 80% glycerol/ 1% KOH, 24 h; 100% glycerol, 24 h x 2).."

        "@value": "Labeling and Isolation of Fluorouracil Tagged RNA by Cytosine Deaminase Expression. Tissues are comprised of different cell types whose interactions elicit distinct gene expression patterns that regulate tissue formation, regeneration, homeostasis and repair. Analysis of these gene expression patterns require methods that can capture as closely as possible the transcriptomes of cells of interest in their tissue microenvironment. Current technologies designed to study in situ transcriptomics are limited by their low sensitivity that require cell types to represent more than 1% of the total tissue, making it challenging to transcriptionally profile rare cell populations rapidly isolated from their native microenvironment. To address this problem, we developed fluorouracil-tagged RNA sequencing (Flura-seq) that utilizes cytosine deaminase (CD) to convert the non-natural pyrimidine fluorocytosine to fluorouracil. Expression of S. cerevisiae CD and exposure to fluorocytosine generates fluorouracil and metabolically labels newly synthesized RNAs specifically in cells of interest. Fluorouracil-tagged RNAs can then be immunopurified and used for downstream analysis. Here, we describe the detailed protocol to perform Flura-seq both in vitro and in vivo. The robustness, simplicity and lack of toxicity of Flura-seq make this tool broadly applicable to many studies in developmental, regenerative, and cancer biology.. Making CD-UPRT expressing stable cells Generate CD-UPRT expressing cell line of interest (for example, MDA-MB-231) by transducing cells with CD-UPRT (Addgene) and rtTA3 (Addgene) lentivirus using standard protocol. Labeling of RNA in vitro Day 1 Plate 1,000 cells (for example, MDA-MB-231) expressing Doxycycline inducible CD-UPRT (cells of interest) with 1 million 4T1 cells (or other cells (optional)) in 60 mm plates in 3 ml volume (Doxycycline inducible system is optional). Day 2 Add 1 μg/ml Doxycycline. Day 3 24 h post Doxycycline treatment, add 5-FC and thymine to 250 μM (50 mM stock) and 125 μM (25 mM stock) final concentration, respectively. 5-FC and thymine stock solutions are made in PBS. Harvest cells after 2-12 h using cell lysis buffer. Wash the cells 1x with 3 ml PBS before adding 1 ml of cell lysis buffer on the plate. Scrape the cells in 1.5 ml eppendorf tube. Labeling of RNA in mice Day 1 Prepare 500,000/ml CD-UPRT expressing stable cells (described above in A.1) in PBS. Inject 100 μl (50,000 cells) in mouse through tail vein. Day 28 Change the mice diet to Doxycycline diet, 3 days before 5-FC injection, if cells are expressing Doxycycline inducible CD-UPRT. Skip this step if cells are constitutively expressing CD-UPRT. Day 31 Inject the mice with 250 μg/kg 5-FC in PBS (12.5 μg/ml stock) intraperitoneally, and 125 μg/kg thymine in PBS (6.25 μg/ml stock) subcutaneously. After 4-12 h, euthanize the mice by CO2 asphyxiation, harvest the organs, and keep the organ in RNAlater buffer. Put the organ of interest (for example, lungs) in 2 ml cell lysis buffer (Recipe 1) in 5 ml Polystyrene Round-Bottom tube, and homogenize the organ with a tissue grinder. Divide the lysate equally into two tubes and add 3 ml of cell lysis buffer in each tube (The lysate can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use). Isolation of mRNA Add 1x volume of cell lysis buffer (4 ml) in the lysate from C.7, rotate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. For in vitro cells, add appropriate volume of lysis buffer (1 ml for confluent 60 mm plates), and scrape the cells. Put the lysate into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube/s, and centrifuge at 16, 000 x g for 5 min at RT, and keep supernatant. Prepare oligo dT25 beads (≥ 100 μl beads/~25 mg of lungs/brain). Place 250 μl beads/Eppendorf tube (1.5 ml) in magnetic rack. Remove the storage buffer. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml cell lysis buffer by pipetting up and down five times. Take out the supernatant (1 ml/250 μl beads) from D.2 and add it to the freshly prepared oligo dT25 beads. Incubate at RT for 10 min in a rotator. Discard the supernatant. Wash the beads 2x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer I (Recipe 2) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Wash the beads 2x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer II (Recipe 3) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer III (Recipe 4) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml TE buffer (Recipe 7) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Add 50 μl of Elution buffer (Recipe 5), and elute the RNA in Eppendorf Thermomixer at 85 °C for 2 min shaking at 750 rpm. Place the beads in magnetic rack and keep the Eluate. The mRNA can be stored at -80 °C for future use. Purification of 5-FU tagged mRNA Prepare 70 μl of protein G beads per sample at RT. Place the beads in magnetic rack, and remove the storage buffer. Upto 350 μl (for 5 samples) of beads can be transferred to one 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Wash the beads with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer (Recipe 6) at RT by pipetting up and down five times. Block the beads with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer containing 10 μg/ml BSA and 20 μg/ml glycogen for 1 h at 4 °C. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down five times. Add 35 μl of beads in 750 μl of 0.5x SSPET buffer containing BrdU antibody (1 μg for RT-PCR, and 5 μg for RNA-seq) in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Rotate at 4 °C overnight. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down five times. Add 35 μl of beads in mRNA (400 μl in this case) from Step D12 diluted with the same volume (400 μl) of 1x SSPET buffer. Total volume will be about 835 μl. Rotate for 2 h using ThermoScientific Rotator at RT. Wash 2x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Wash 2x with 1 ml of 1x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Wash 1x with 1 ml of TE buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times. Elute the bound mRNA with 200 μl of 100 μg/ml BrdU in TE buffer in Eppendorf Thermomixer at 900 rpm for 45 min at RT. Keep the supernatant (5-FU tagged mRNA). Mix the 200 μl supernatant with 700 μl of RLT buffer from RNeasy kit. Add 500 μl of 100% ethanol, and mix well. Pass the solution through RNeasy column. Wash 1x with 500 μl of RPE buffer from RNeasy kit. Wash 1x with 500 μl of 80% ethanol. Spin at 13,000 x g for 2 min at RT. Elute the RNA with 200 μl of RNase free water. Add 600 μl of 0.5x SSPET to the elute. Wash the Protein G Dynabeads incubated with BrdU antibody as described in Step E6. Re-immunoprecipitate 5-FU tagged mRNA as described in Steps E7-E13. Purify RNA as described in Steps E14-E19 using RNeasy MiniElute Cleanup kit, and elute the RNA with 12.5 μl RNase free water. Proceed with cDNA synthesis for RT-PCR or RNA-seq. Labeling and Purification of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) tagged mRNA from co-cultured cells and from mouse lungs in xenograft model 1,000 human MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with CD-UPRT (Addgene) and rtTA3 (Addgene) (MDA231-CDUPRT) were co-cultured with 1 million mouse 4T1 cells. RNAs were labeled as described in Section B, and 5-FU tagged mRNAs were purified as described in Section D and E. Enrichment of 5-FU tagged mRNAs of representative human and mouse genes relative to non immuno-purified mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Figure 1A). 5 x 104 MDA231-CDUPRT cells were injected in the mouse lungs through tail vein. After 28 days, CD UPRT expression was induced by feeding mice with doxycycline diet for 3 days, and RNA was labeled as described in Section C, and 5-FU tagged mRNA was purified as described in Section D and E. Enrichment of 5-FU tagged mRNAs of representative human and mouse genes relative to non immuno-purified mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Labeling and isolation of 5-FU tagged RNA by cytosine deaminase expression. A. 1,000 human MDA-MB-231 cells expressing CD-UPRT were co-cultured with 1 million mouse 4T1 cells, and 5-FU tagged mRNA from human cells were isolated as described in the protocol, and enrichment of representative human genes and mouse genes relative to their corresponding 2% inputs (non immuno-purified mRNA) are shown (n = 3, ± SEM). B. 50,000 MDA-MB-231 cells expressing CD-UPRT were injected to the lungs through tail vein, and after 28 days, 5-FU tagged mRNA was isolated as described in the protocol, and the enrichment of representative human and mouse genes relative to 1% inputs (non immune-purified mRNAs) were measured by RT-PCR (n = 6, ± SEM). “h” indicates human and “m” indicates mouse.. In an organ, cells interact with tissue microenvironment that includes organ-specific resident cells, immune cells, perivascular niches, extracellular matrix, cytokines, metabolites, and an oxygen concentration range. These interactions dictate the expression of specific set of genes in the cells that often have functional significances. The transcriptional responses associated with these interactions are usually dynamic and can only be observed if the interactions are preserved. Thus, it is critical to maintain the tissue microenvironment to ensure the capture of true transcriptional state of cells under the physiological conditions.Current techniques to study cell-type specific transcriptomes have limitations that preclude their effective application in studying rare and under-represented cell populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with or without an intervening fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) step, requires extensive physical and enzymatic processing of the tissue, which not only disrupts the effects of the host microenvironment on cells but also exerts stress on these cells, severely compromising the ability to discern the impact of the host stroma from the transcriptome of the isolated cells. As many as 7,500 genes have been reported to be altered by more than two-fold during the FACS processing of muscle stem cells for transcriptomic analysis (Machado et al., 2017). In situ transcriptomic profiling obviate these problems but lack the necessary sensitivity for cell populations that represent less than 1% of the tissue. For example, translating ribosome affinity purification and mRNA sequencing (TRAP-Seq) (Heiman et al., 2008) is not suitable to analyze cells that constitute less than 1% of the total population (Bertin et al., 2015; Obenauf et al., 2015). Direct enzyme based metabolic tagging of RNA with thiouracil (TU) and ethynyl cytosine (EC) in the cells of interest are limited in sensitivity and specificity due to collateral tagging of RNA in cells lacking the enzymes, and requires additional in vitro biotinylation steps (Cleary et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Gay et al., 2013 and 2014; Hida et al., 2017). TU tagging has a sensitivity limit of 5% (Gay et al., 2013). Thiol (SH)-linked alkylation of the metabolic labeling of RNA in tissue (SLAM-ITseq) eliminates the noise associated with the purification of RNAs that are not thiol tagged in TU-tagging method (Matsushima et al., 2018), but undesired TU tagging through endogenous enzymes in cells lacking UPRT expression remains a limitation. We described the development of Flura-seq, a cytosine deaminase (CD)-based method for in situ transcriptomic profiling of rare cell populations that represent as little as 0.003% of an organ (Basnet et al., 2019). Flura-seq requires exogenous expression of CD, a key enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway in fungi and prokaryotes (Mullen et al., 1992) and UPRT from T. gondii. CD is absent in mammalian cells, which instead use cytidine deaminase for the same purpose (Mullen et al., 1992). In addition to converting cytosine to uracil, CD can also convert 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), a non-natural pyrimidine, to 5-flourouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is endogenously converted to fluorouridine triphosphate (F-UTP), which is then incorporated into RNA. The co-expression of UPRT limits the labeling of RNA in the cells expressing CD (Basnet et al., 2019). Flura-seq is applicable to in vitro co-culture experiments as well as in vivo experiments where cells of interest, expressing CD-UPRT, are present in the intact tissue. Flura-seq is technically very simple that only requires very basic molecular biology skills, and the whole procedures can be completed within 24 hours. Here, we describe the detailed protocol for labeling and isolation of RNA for Flura-seq for both in vitro and in vivo experiments."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the bacterial pathogen responsible for tuberculosis, a human pulmonary infectious disease. Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) is the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle, and is often used as the vaccine stain in humans. Specific recipes and methods for culture of MTB and BCG are described in this protocol.. Culture Preparing 7H9 liquid medium Day 1: Resuspend 1 frozen vial of 1 ml (450 million) MTB or BCG (stored in 15% glycerol and 85% 7H9 liquid medium) in 20 ml 7H9 liquid medium in a T75 flask. Culture horizontally in an incubator humidified at 37 °C without CO2 for 5 - 14 days. Measure the OD600 every 5 days, till OD600 reaches 2.0. Viable MTB/BCG colonies can be counted by plating bacterial suspensions at different dilutions on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates supplemented with OADC, and then counting colonies after two weeks. Harvest the bacteria through spin-down at room temperature, 3,000 x g for 7 min. Detection: Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining detection procedure Pipet 10 μl MTB/BCG culture on a glass microscope slide and heat on top of a Bunsen flame until it is completely dry to fix the bacteria. Flood the slide with carbol fuchsin stain (BD kit reagent A). Heat the slide gently until it steams (5 min). Pour off the carbol fuchsin. Wash slide thoroughly with tap water (5 min). Decolorize with acid-alcohol (5 min). Wash slide thoroughly with tap water (5 min). Flood slide with methylene blue (BD kit reagent B) counterstain (1 min). Wash with tap water. Blot excess water and dry in hand over Bunsen flame. The slide is now ready to observe under a standard light microscope.."

        "@value": "A Mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP Method for Molecular Diagnosis of Highly Variable Viruses. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been widely used in the detection of pathogens. However, there are usually numerous variants in one viral pathogen and primers employed in LAMP can hardly match all these variants. The mismatches between the primers and the viral genomes, especially those at the 3′-end of the primers, hinder LAMP reactions, leading to failure of the detection. Here, we present a mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP protocol, which utilizes the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase to remove potential mismatched bases at the 3′-end of the primers during LAMP amplification. Using HIV-1 as a proof-of-principle, we showed that this protocol could represent a promising tool for accurate detection of genetically unstable viruses in laboratory, hospital and field.. Preparation of HIV-1 wild type and mutant RNA standards Construct two mutant pUC57-IN plasmids using the fast mutagenesis system according to the following steps. Primers for construction of the mutant plasmids are in Table 2. Prepare the PCR reaction mixes (Table 3), PCR cycling condition: Enzyme activation and pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 20 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by extending at 72 °C for 10 min. Table 2. Primers for construction of two HIV-1 mutant plasmids Note: Introduced mutant is shown in Red font. F: forward primer; R: reverse primer; Mu: mutant. Table 3. PCR reaction mixes of the construction of two HIV-1 mutants Note: F: forward primer; R: reverse primer; Mu: mutant. Electrophoresis detection: measure 10 μl PCR product using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis at a constant voltage (140 V) for about 30 min. PCR product digestion: add 1 μl of DMT enzyme to the remaining PCR product, mix and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Add 5 μl of DMT digestion product to 50 μl of competent cells, mix and place on ice for 30 min. Then place the mixture at 42 °C for 45 s, and on ice for 2 min. Add 250 μl of room temperature LB medium (without antibiotics) to the mixture, 200 rpm, 37 °C for 1 h. Spread 100 μl of the bacterial solution evenly on a plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubate overnight in a 37 °C incubator. Pick the mono-clones into 3 ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, for shaking culture (200 rpm), at 37 °C for 10-12 h. Extract the plasmid DNA for Sanger sequencing (Shanghai Platinum Company) and verify the presence of the mutation. Store the mutated plasmids at -20 °C for subsequent experiments. Amplify the HIV-1 integrase segment using T7 promotor-containing primer pair (HIV T7-F: TAATACGACTCACTATAGACGGTTAGGGCCGCCTGT and HIV R: CAGTCGACGGGCCCGGGA) with the wild-type and mutant HIV-1 plasmids as templates. In a 0.2 ml PCR® tube with cap, a PCR reaction mix includes 25 μl 2x DreamTaqTM Green PCR Master Mix, 2 μl of 10 μM of each primer (HIV T7-F and HIV R primer) and 2 μl HIV-1 plasmid in a final volume of 50 μl. The cycling condition is enzyme activation and pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, fully extending at 72 °C for 10 min. Measure the PCR product using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at a constant voltage (140 V) for about 30 min. After electrophoresis, cut the specific PCR product from the gel under UV control and purify according to the manufacturer′s instruction using the QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit. Obtain RNAs through in vitro transcription with the purified DNA as templates using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit. Quantify the obtained RNA using NanoDropTM 2000 Spectrophotometer, and calculate the RNA copy number using the following formula: RNA copies/ml = [RNA concentration (g/ml)/(nt transcript length × 340)] × 6.022 × 1023 Dilute RNA to 104 copies/ul, aliquot to 40 μl in a 0.2 ml PCR® tube with cap and store at -80 °C until use. Plasma sample viral RNA extraction Extract viral RNA from 140 μl of plasma using the QIAgen Viral RNA Mini Kit following the manufacturer′s instruction. Elute the extracted RNA in 50 μl of nuclease-free water, aliquot to 25 μl per tube, and store at -80 °C until use. Qualitative detection of HIV-1 by the real-time mismatch-tolerant HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay Preparation of mixed primer sets (Table 4) Prepare the mixed primer set 1 by adding 5 μl 100 μm each of primers AceIN-F3, AceIN-B3a, and AceIN-B3b into 85 μl nuclease-free water; the mixed primer set 2 includes 20 μl 100 μm each of primers AceIN-FIPf and AceIN-FIPe, 40 μl 100 μm AceIN-BIP, and 20 μl nuclease-free water; the mixed primer set 3 includes 20 μl 100 μm each of primers AceIN-LF and AceIN-LB, and 60 μl nuclease-free water. Preparation of the real-time RT-LAMP mix (Table 5) In a 96-well PCR plate or 8-tube PCR strip, each 25 μl reaction mix includes 3 μl RNA template (RNA standard or RNA extracts from clinical sample), 2.5 μl 10x isothermal amplification buffer, 1 μl 100mM MgSO4, 3.5 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 0.075 μl 2 units of Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase, 1 μl 8 units of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, 0.5 μl 15 units of warmstart RTx reverse transcriptase, 1 μl 1 mM SYTO 9, and 1 μl each mixed primer set (mixed primer set 1-3 in Table 4). Table 4. Mixed primer sets preparation of the mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP assay Note: The regular assay is recommended when no degenerate primers is used. RT-LAMP cycling condition: Perform the reaction at 62 °C for 1 min by 60 cycles. Collect fluorescence signal at each cycle. Colorimetric RT-LAMP detection (Table 5) Preparation of the colorimetric RT-LAMP mix (Table 5) In an 8-tube PCR strip, each 25 μl reaction mix includes 12.5 μl warmstart colorimetric LAMP 2x master mix, 1 μl each mixed primer set (mixed primer sets 1-3 in Table 4), 0.075 μl 2 units of Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase, and 3 μl of RNA template (RNA standard or RNA extracts from clinical sample). Colorimetric RT-LAMP cycling condition: Perform the reaction at 62 °C for 50 min. Observe the color change at 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-min time points by naked eyes.. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are serious threats to global public health (Mehand et al., 2018). Many outbreaks and epidemics have been caused by viruses, such as HIV-1, HCV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, A/H7N9 influenza virus, and more recently Zika virus. These viral diseases have led to high morbidity and mortality that disproportionally impacted on low-income countries (Van Doorn, 2017; Fenollar and Mediannikov, 2018; Waldman and Balskus, 2018). Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral pathogens is crucial for the prevention and control of viral infectious diseases (Mehand et al., 2018). Isothermal amplification techniques represent a promising direction for the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) diagnostic tools especially in the low-income countries or resource-limited settings (de Paz et al., 2014). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is the most widely used isothermal amplification technology in biomedical research (Notomi et al., 2000). Its principle is auto-cycling strand displacement DNA amplification reaction using Bst DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity under isothermal condition. LAMP generally uses three pairs of primers, and two inner primers (FIP and BIP) are responsible for initiating the self-primed DNA synthesis of the dumbbell form DNA. However, the biggest challenge for the detection of viruses using LAMP is the high genetic diversity of some viral genomes, which exist in the forms of genotypes, subtypes, and/or quasispecies (Sanjuan et al., 2010; Domingo and Perales, 2018). These diverse forms can easily cause mismatches with primers during their amplification, thereby resulting in a low sensitivity of detection and a limited spectrum of detection (Zhang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). It is virtually impossible to detect all variants or serotypes in one LAMP assay as the conserved regions in the genomes are usually too short to completely match the long (approximately 40 nt) inner primers (FIP and BIP) of the assay. Therefore, an underestimate of viral load or even failure of detection is common using RT-LAMP method, especially for highly variable RNA viruses (Waldman and Balskus, 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). This may be the most important reason that limits the commercial application of LAMP in the diagnosis of viral infectious diseases (Wong et al., 2018). To overcome this problem, we recently developed a mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP method that contains a minuscule amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase and utilizes its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity to remove potential mismatched bases at the 3′-end of the primers during amplification (Zhou et al., 2019). The new method was demonstrated to be especially suited for the detection of highly variable viruses (Zhou et al., 2019). In this paper, we provide a detailed protocol of the mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP method using HIV-1 detection as an example (Table 1)."

        "@value": "Co-culture of Human Stem Cell Derived Neurons and Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells. Crosstalk between neurons and oligodendrocytes is important for proper brain functioning. Multiple co-culture methods have been developed to study oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination or the effect of oligodendrocytes on neurons. However, most of these methods contain cells derived from animal models. In the current protocol, we co-culture human neurons with human oligodendrocytes. Neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were differentiated separately from pluripotent stem cells according to previously published protocols. To study neuron-glia cross-talk, neurons and OPCs were plated in co-culture mode in optimized conditions for additional 28 days, and prepared for OPC maturation and neuronal morphology analysis. To our knowledge, this is one of the first neuron-OPC protocols containing all human cells. Specific neuronal abnormalities not observed in mono-cultures of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) neurons, became apparent when TSC neurons were co-cultured with TSC OPCs. These results show that this co-culture system can be used to study human neuron-OPC interactive mechanisms involved in health and disease.. Neuronal differentiation Neurons are differentiated according to previously published protocols (Shi et al., 2012; Nadadhur et al., 2017), shortly: hiPSCs are passaged onto Geltrex-coated 12-well plates in 1 ml TesRE8 medium with 10 μM RI per well. Refresh all medium every day. After 2 days (or when cells are 100% confluent), add 1 ml neural maintenance medium (NMM) with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542. Refresh all medium every day until Day 12. Note: Between Days 8 and 12 a uniform neuroepithelial sheet should appear (see Figure 1). Prepare a PLO/mLaminin coated 6-well plate as described in the Recipes. Collect neuroepithelial rosette cells (NES cells) by manually cutting them (see description in note) and plate them in the 6-well plate. Note: Prepare fresh pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542 + 10 μM RI. Remove the medium from the 12-well plate, wash the wells with PBS once and add 1 ml of the freshly prepared medium. Sterilize the microscope area with 70% Ethanol and cut the rosettes using a 10 μl tip to mark their borders and to lift them up. Collect the floating rosettes with a 5 ml pipette and move them to the PLO/mLaminin coated 6-well plate with NMM with vitamin A + 1 μM Dorsomorphin + 10 μM SB431542 + 10 μM RI. All rosettes from 1 well of a 12-well plate are plated in 1 well of a 6-well plate. Figure 1. Brightfield picture showing neural rosette structures that form between Days 8 and 12. Scale bar = 200 μm. On Day 13, change the medium to 2 ml pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 20 ng/ml bFGF + 20 ng/ml EGF. Every day remove 1 ml of medium and add 1 ml pre-warmed NMM with vitamin A + 40 ng/ml bFGF + 40 ng/ml EGF. When confluent, passage the cells with TrypLE in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio as described in the note below. Notes: Cells can be kept in NES cell stage for 1-4 passages. Growth factor concentration is double when only half the medium is changed: together with the medium left in the well the concentration will be similar to the concentration in Step A7. TrypLE passage: Remove all medium from the well and add 300 μl pre-warmed TrypLE. Swirl it around the well and incubate for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Add 600 μl of pre-warmed DTI or medium to stop the reaction and collect the cells into a tube containing 5 ml NMM. Spin down at 300 x g for 5 min at RT and re-suspend the pellet in desired medium. To start the neuronal induction, plate the NES cells after a TrypLE passage in a PLO/mLaminin-coated 12-well plate in pre-warmed 1 ml NMM + 20 ng/ml bFGF + 20 ng/ml EGF per well. When cells reach 80%-90% confluence, switch half of the medium (500 μl/well) to pre-warmed N2 medium + 800 ng/ml hSHH. Note: This is considered Day 1 of the differentiation protocol. Until Day 4, refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) daily with pre-warmed N2 medium + 800 ng/ml hSHH. On Day 5, switch half of the medium (500 μl/well) to pre-warmed NB medium + 40 μM VPA. Until Day 7, refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) daily with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 μM VPA. Prepare PLO/mLaminin-coated 12-well plates before Day 8 as described in the Recipes. On Day 8, passage the neural progenitors with accutase 1:2 or 1:3 to a new well (see note for explanation). Plate cells in pre-warmed 1.5 ml NB medium + 20 ng/ml BDNF + 10 ng/ml GDNF + 10 ng/ml IGF1 + 1 μM cAMP. Accutase treatment: Remove all medium, add 300 μl of accutase per well of a 12-well plate and return the plate to the incubator for 5-7 min. By gently tapping the plate, the cells will visibly come off. At this point, collect the cells in a tube, add 5 ml fresh pre-warmed medium, spin at 300 x g for 5 min at RT and re-suspend the pellet in the desired medium. Resuspend carefully; do not break clumps into single cells. Until Day 18 refresh medium three times a week by removing 1 ml of medium and adding 1 ml of pre-warmed NB medium + 30 ng/ml BDNF + 15 ng/ml GDNF + 15 ng/ml IGF1 + 1.5 μM cAMP. On Day 12, prepare a 12-well sandwich plate as described in the note, Figure 2 and Video 1. Coat the plate with Geltrex as described in the Recipes. Plate 25,000 primary rat astrocytes in each well containing pre-warmed DMEM/F12 medium with Glutamax + 10% FBS + 1x NEAA + 1x Pen/Strep. Note: Sandwich plate preparation: Take a 12-well plate and heat up a sterile syringe needle in flame. Punch in 4 corners of each well to make uniform small bumps in the plastic bottom of the well. These bumps will help suspend a coverslip on them, separated by a small distance from the cells in the bottom of the well. See Figure 2 and Video 1. Video 1. Sandwich plate Before Day 18, prepare the desired amount of 12-well plates containing 18 mm diameter coverslips and coat with PLO/laminin as described in the Recipes. Note: Coverslips can be stored by sealing the plate tightly with parafilm for maximum 1 week at 4 °C. On Day 18, make a single-cell suspension of the neurons using accutase as described in the note. Plate 1.5 million cells per 12-well plate on the pre-coated PLO/mLaminin coverslips in pre-warmed 1 ml NB medium + 20 ng/ml BDNF + 10 ng/ml GDNF + 10 ng/ml IGF1 + 1 μM cAMP. Note: Remove all medium, add 300 μl of accutase per well of a 12-well plate and return the plate to the incubator for 10-15 min. By gently tapping the plate, the cells will visibly come off. Dissociate the cells in the accutase using a 1000 μl pipette very slowly and pipet into a 15 ml tube with 5 ml of neurobasal medium. Spin at 300 x g for 5 min at RT. Remove supernatant and very gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of NB medium and try breaking the clumps of cells very gently using a 1000 μl pipette (pipet up and down maximum 3-4 times). Then leave the tube for 2-5 min to let the big clumps settle down at the bottom. Take the supernatant into another tube; thrash the pellet (the big clumps will not have mature cells but mainly proliferating precursor cells). Figure 2. Sandwich plate preparation. A. Take a 12-well plate and a sterile syringe needle. Flame the needle until it is hot. With the hot needle, make a bump on 4 sides of the well (B-D). The astrocytes will be plated on the bottom of the plate, and a coverslip with neurons can be inverted on top. The coverslip will lean on the bumps. See also Video 1. On Day 19, turn the coverslips with adhered neurons upside down over the bumps on the astrocyte plates. Note: By now, the astrocytes should have reached 80% confluence in order to support the neurons. Change half of the medium (500 μl/well) twice a week with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 ng/ml BDNF + 20 ng/ml GDNF + 20 ng/ml IGF1 + 2 μM cAMP. On the day before the second refresh (Day 24/25), add 1 μM AraC to cultures to stop proliferation. Next day (Day 25/26) refresh half of the medium (500 μl/well) with pre-warmed NB medium + 40 ng/ml BDNF + 20 ng/ml GDNF + 20 ng/ml IGF1 + 2 μM cAMP. Keep cultures until Day 37 (see Figure 3), while refreshing medium twice a week as described in Step 21. Figure 3. Brightfield picture of Day-37 neurons prior to co-culture showing neuronal network formation in sandwich culture. Scale bar = 100 μm. OPC differentiation OPCs are generated according to previously published protocol (Izrael et al., 2007), shortly: hiPSCs are passaged with EDTA and plated on an anti-adherent 6-well plate in 3 ml pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RI + 20 ng/ml T3 per well for embryoid body (EB) formation (see Figure 3). Note: Use 2 wells of iPSCs for 1 well of EBs. The next day (Day 1), refresh ⅔ of the medium: swirl cells to the middle of the wells and carefully aspirate 2 ml of medium. Add 2 ml of pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RI + 20 ng/ml T3. On Day 2, refresh ⅔ of the medium as described in Step B2 with pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RA. Repeat every other day. On Day 10, plate EBs on Geltrex-coated plate as described in the note. If EBs become very dark, or decrease in density, plate EBs sooner than on Day 10, but not before Day 4. In our experience, Day 8 is mostly ideal (see Figure 4). Note: Plate EBs on geltrex coated plate by collecting the medium with EBs in a 15 or 50 ml tube. Leave the tube for 2-3 min to let the EBs settle. Carefully aspirate most of the medium, and resuspend EBs in the appropriate amount of desired medium (1 ml for a 12-well plate; 2 ml for a 6-well plate). On Days 4-9, EBs are plated in pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 4 ng/ml bFGF + 10 μM RA + 20 ng/ml T3. If EBs are plated on Day 10, NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 20 ng/ml T3 should be used instead. Figure 4. Brightfield pictures showing embryoid body formation (A) and outgrowth of cells from embryoid bodies after plating on a geltrex-coated plate (B). Scale bars = 500 μm. On Day 10, switch all medium to pre-warmed NMM with Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF + 20 ng/ml T3. From now on: refresh ⅔ of the medium every other day and split cells when they reach 90% density to a new Geltrex-coated plate using accutase. Note: Add RI to medium after passaging to help the cells recover. On Day 18, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 20 ng/ml EGF; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7. On Day 37, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 5 ng/ml bFGF + 5 ng/ml EGF + 1 μg/ml mLaminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7. On Day 39, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 5 ng/ml bFGF + 5 ng/ml EGF + 1 μg/ml mLaminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C + 50 ng/ml noggin; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7. On Day 42, change medium to NMM without Vit A + 1 μg/ml mouse laminin + 50 μg/ml Vit C + 50 ng/ml noggin; keep refreshing and splitting cells as described in Step B7. Keep OPC cultures in the medium of Step B11 until Day 65 (see Figure 5). Figure 5. OPC differentiation. At the end of the OPC differentiation protocol, cells show a glial morphology (A, Day 45) and express OPC markers like OLIG2 (B, Day 65). Scale bars = 100 μm. Neuron-OPC co-culture At day 1 of co-culture, move the Day 37 neurons and plate Day 65 OPCs on top: Take a new 12-well plate. Pick the Day 37 neuronal coverslips up with a forceps from the rat astrocyte plate and plate in a new 12-well plate (with neurons on top, so flip coverslip compared to how it was on astrocyte plate). Note: No coating is necessary for the new plate as the neuronal coverslips already contain the coating. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium. Get a plate with Day 65 OPCs. Remove medium and wash plate once with PBS. Remove PBS and add 750 μl accutase to every well (6-well plate). Incubate the plate for 5-10 min at 37 °C. Check if cells are detaching from the plate by gentle tapping; if not, incubate longer. When cells are detaching, collect cell suspension in a 15 ml tube with 9 ml pre-warmed DMEM/F12. Spin down 5 min at 300 x g at RT. Resuspend cells in 1 ml of pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium. Remove 10 μl of cell suspension for cell count. Plate 4 x 105 OPCs per coverslip on a 12-well plate. Refresh ½ of the medium twice a week: remove 500 μl of medium and add 500 μl of new pre-warmed neuroglia co-culture medium. At Day 28 of co-culture, fix cells with 4% PFA for 15-20 min and use coverslips for immunostaining immediately (see Figure 6). Figure 6. Immunostaining of co-cultures. (A) shows many OLIG2-positive OPCs and MBP-positive mature oligodendrocytes with MAP2-positive dendrites. (B) shows oligodendrocytes (MBP-positive) closely interacting with dendrites (MAP2-positive) Scale bars = 25 μm. Immunostaining Wash plate 6 x 5 min with PBS. Remove PBS. Add 300 μl blocking buffer per well. Incubate for 1 h at RT. Remove blocking buffer. Add primary antibodies diluted in 300 μl blocking buffer. Incubate for 1 h at RT, then overnight at 4 °C. Wash 6 x 5 min with PBS. Add secondary antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in 300 μl blocking buffer. Incubate for 2 h at RT. Wash 6 x 5 min with PBS. Remove PBS. Add DAPI 1:1000 diluted in PBS. Incubate for 2 min at RT. Wash 1 x with PBS. Mount coverslips with Fluoromount G upside down on a microscopical slide.. The human brain consists of an immense complex organization of cells that we are only recently starting to identify, and that cannot be studied in animal models. The human brain also contains a high white matter content, which is suggested to account for higher brain functions, such as social and cognitive learning (Maldonado and Angulo, 2015; Almeida and Lyons, 2016; Kougioumtzidou et al., 2017). Single cell expression studies in animals indicate that oligodendrocytes form heterogeneous populations of cells (Marques et al., 2016). This supports the notion that oligodendrocytes fulfill more complex functions than solely isolating axons. As the human comprises of higher diversity of neurons compared to rodent brain, and considering the role of white matter in complex functions in learning and cognition, we could expect an even more complex diversity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the human brain. Therefore, we need to identify oligodendrocyte-neuron crosstalk in the human brain. Next to the classic white matter disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and the leukodystrophies (van der Knaap and Bugiani, 2017), white matter abnormalities are consistently been found in psychiatric disorders (Haroutunian et al., 2014). Increasing evidence shows that crosstalk between neurons and oligodendrocytes is important for proper neural network functioning (Bergles et al., 2000; Velez-Fort et al., 2010; Maldonado and Angulo, 2015) and myelin formation (Almeida and Lyons, 2016; Kougioumtzidou et al., 2017). Therefore, to study the involvement of neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions in the normal and diseased brains, we are in need of human-based model systems. As current assays mostly involve non-human cells (Cui et al., 2010; Hill et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2017; Pang et al., 2018; Treichel and Hines, 2018), we developed human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based co-culture models to study crosstalk between human neurons and human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). The presented co-culture method was used to study neuron-OPC interactions in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) (Nadadhur et al., 2019), a genetic multisystem disorder that shows both grey and white matter abnormalities in the brain. Although some neuronal abnormalities were present in mono-cultures of TSC neurons, in the presence of OPCs increased axonal density and hypertrophy became apparent (Nadadhur et al., 2019). This suggests that specific neuronal phenotypes can only be studied when oligodendrocytes are present. Vice versa oligodendrocyte maturation is highly dependent on neuronal signaling. Therefore these culture systems can be applied to study multiple processes in health and disease in which complex neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions are involved, and provide prospects for the development of drug screening platforms for all-human cells, e.g., patient iPSCs. To conclude, this novel human neuron-OPC co-culture model can be used to study neuron-OPC crosstalk in health and disease."

        "@value": "Subcellular Fractionation of Cultured Human Cell Lines. Subcellular localization is crucial for the proper functioning of a protein. Deregulation of subcellular localization may lead to pathological consequences and result in diseases like cancer. Immuno-fluorescent staining and subcellular fractionation can be used to determine localization of a protein. Here we discuss a protocol to separate the nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions of cultured human cell lines using a centrifuge and ultracentrifuge. The membrane fraction contains plasma membranes and ER-golgi membranes, but no mitochondria or nuclear structures. The fractions can be further analyzed using Western blotting. This protocol is based on that from Dr. Richard Patten at Abcam, and was modified and utilized in a publication by Huang et al. (2012).. Culture cells on 100 mm culture plate until 75% confluent in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2. For beginners, the well-studied HEK293 and its derivatives are recommended for easy maintenance and ectopic protein expression. Note: This is for adherent cell. Suspension cells may need centrifugation before lysis. Wash twice with ice-cold PBS and immediately add 500 μl per 100 mm plate of SF buffer and put on ice, use cell scraper to collect lysate and transfer to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. If multiple samples are collected, process one specimen at a time. Agitate the lysates at 4 °C for 30 min at around 30-50 rpm on the tube roller. Centrifuge at 720 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube for future use. Keep the pellet for next step. Wash the pellet with 500 μl of SF buffer and disperse the pellet with a pipette. Centrifuge the pellet at 720 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in NL buffer. Agitate and incubate at 4 °C for 15 min. Optional: Sonicate the pellet on ice (2 x 3 sec sonication, separated by 3 sec resting, under 30% full amplitude power. On ice!). This is the nuclear fraction including nuclear membranes. Centrifuge the supernatant from step 4 at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube. This is the cytosolic and membrane fraction. Centrifuge the cytosolic and membrane fraction from step 9 in an ultracentrifuge. Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 1 h. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube. This is the cytosolic fraction. Wash the pellet with 500 μl of SF buffer and re-suspend by pipetting. Ultracentrifuge the pellet at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 1 h. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in NL buffer. Optional: Sonicate the pellet on ice (same setting as for nuclear fraction in step 7). This is the membrane fraction. Internal loading control for Western blotting could be used to make sure each fraction does not cross-contaminate others; but relative amount can also be determined between samples to ensure equal loading. For example, alpha-tubulin is used for the cytosolic fraction; histone H3 is used for the nuclear fraction; Brilliant Blue R is used for staining for the membrane fraction. Use an extra gel for the loading controls. Alpha-tubulin and histone H3 are probed after protein is transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Brilliant Blue R staining can be applied directly to the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1). Note: Brilliant Blue R is used here for monitoring relative amount of protein loading across different samples, but is unable to show cross contamination. Membrane proteins such as EGF receptor and integrins may be used to confirm cross-contamination between the membrane and other fractions. However the recycling of these membrane proteins can be an issue, which may appear to be false-positive cross-contamination. Figure 1. Western blotting of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane fractions with internal controls. Alpha-tubulin and histone H3 are used for the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively; Brilliant Blue R staining is applied for the membrane fraction.."

        "@value": "In vitro Culture of Human PBMCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) consist of chiefly of lymphocytes and monocytes. Purified PBMCs are used in vitro to evaluate a variety of functions of lymphocytes viz; a) proliferation to mitogenic (PHA, Con-A) stimulation, b) monitoring of prior sensitisation in antigen recall assays by scoring lymphocyte proliferation, c) immunophenotyping for surface markers as well as intracellular molecules in monocytes and lymphocytes etc. Activation of monocytes/macrophages by small molecules, cytokines and pathogen components can also be monitored. PBMCs can also be used for a variety of structural and functional studies for addressing issues in human immunology such as scoring for apoptosis and production of cytokines as well as other mediators in vitro.. Collect about 4 ml of human venous blood sample in heparinised vials and mix well by gently inverting the tubes several times. Isolate human PBMCs by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Histophaque. Wash cells (centrifuge at 100 x g for 10 min) with 10 ml of sterile DMEM (without FBS) twice. Note: Cold DMEM is not used routinely for washing lymphocytes from culture cavities while setting up cultures. Rather when monocytes bound tightly to plastic cavities are needed to be harvested pre-chilled DMEM can be used. Discard medium and re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of sterile Dulbecco's modified eagle medium. Count cells by haemocytometer using W.B.C. diluting fluid: Add 10 µl of cell suspension to 190 µl of W.B.C. diluting fluid and mix well. Load the cell suspension in a haemocytometer and count the cells. Adjust cell concentration at 1 x 106 cells/ml with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 1% of Pencillin-streptomycin solution and 10% FBS. The approximate yield of cells from 4 ml of blood varies between 107-108. Seed 500 µl of cell suspension in a 24 well culture plate. Note: Monocytes in PBMCs get attached to the plastic in about 2-3 h when incubated at 37 °C. Longer incubation will result in firm attachement. Lymphocytes are not glass adherent and they will be mostly in suspension and can be removed by mildly flushing the wells with medium and/or buffer. Such treatment will keep the monocytes firmly attached to the surface of culture plates. Cells can be treated with different antigens for different period of times and the supernatants can be analysed for cytokine levels. The cells can be analysed for phenotypic change, apoptosis or proliferation. Note: PBMCs are primary cells and cannot be cultured for more than one passage under normal conditions. Lymphocytes of PBMCs can be made to proliferate in vitro by mitogens e.g., Phytohaemagglutin or Concanavin-A etc over a period to 72-96 h. Monocytes generally are end cells and do not proliferate. In absence of mitogens the proliferation of PBMCs will be negligible.."

        "@value": "Isolation and Culture of Mouse Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages (BMM’phi’). Bone marrow derived macrophages are a type of white blood cell that can be isolated from mammalian bone marrow. In this protocol, a method is described in which bone marrow cells are isolated from mouse leg bones (femur and tibia), and then differentiated to bone marrow-derived macrophages in approximately 10-day culture using L929-conditioned medium.. Preparation of L-cell conditioned medium: culture L929 cells with initial 50% confluence in RPMI + 10% FBS for 5 days, collect the medium and filter with 0.22 μm filter, aliquot and store at -20 °C. Note: Incubate FBS at 50 °C for 30 min before using. Prepare bone marrow growth medium and BMM’phi’ growth medium (see Recipes). Isolation of mouse bone marrow cells. Sacrifice mouse and immerse mouse in 75% ethanol. Clip the skin mid-back and remove the skin from the lower part of the body. Remove tissue from legs with scissors and dissect away from body. Clean remaining tissue from the pelvic and femoral bones and separate at knee joint. Be careful not to break the bones. It is important to make sure that all the tissue is removed from the bones since cells associated with this can contaminate the marrow preparation and potentially overgrow the macrophages. Immerse the bones in 75% ethanol for 5 min, then immerse them in DPBS for 5 min and leave them in RPMI+P/S until the next step. Cut off each end of bone. Using a 27 g needle/1 ml syringe filled with bone marrow growth medium; expel the bone marrow from both ends of the bone with a jet of medium directed into a 15 ml cell culture dish. Change medium every 3 days. While in culture, some of the cells become attached, while many of them still grow in suspension, so spin-down and re-culture those cells in new dishes. After about 10 days, almost all cells become attached BMM’phi’s, and then BMM’phi’ growth medium is used for further culture and tests.."

        "@value": "RNA Isolation from Synechocystis. The protocol describes the procedure of total RNA isolation from cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This protocol is also applicable to Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and PCC 6301, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, and other unicellular and filamentous species of cyanobacteria that do not have thick polysaccharide-containing outer layers. For the latter, Trizol-containing protocols should be adapted. The yield of RNA depends on optical density of cyanobacterial culture and may reach up to 10-20 µg of total RNA per 1 ml of cell culture. RNA isolated by this method can be used for Northern blot hybridization, RT-qPCR, microarrays and Next Generation Sequencing.. Probes fixation Prepare 25 ml portions of cell fix solution in 50 ml plastic conical polypropylene tubes. Keep on ice. Pour 25 ml of cyanobacterial cell culture into 25 ml of ice-cold cell fix solution (Figure 1.1). Stir well and proceed to centrifugation or store samples at -20 °C up to 1 month. For 50-ml of cyanobacterial cultures, two 50 ml tubes should be used. Alternatively, 100-200 ml centrifuge bottles resistant to phenol and ethanol may be used. Harvest fixed cells by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5-10 min at 4 °C (Figure 1.2). Discard cell fix solution leaving 0,5-1 ml of solution to resuspend the pellet. Resuspend the pellet by vortexing or pipetting. Transfer a suspension into a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf tube. If 50 ml tubes are used for cell fixation and harvesting, combine two probes from 25 ml tubes in one 2 ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 3,000-5,000 x g, 4 °C for 3-5 min and completely remove supernatant (Figure 1.3). Leave pelleted cells on ice. Note: Probes fixation is applied to kill cells immediately and to avoid possible degradation of RNA. This is extremely important when temperature-dependent changes in specific mRNAs are under study. Figure 1. Steps of RNA extraction. 1. Fixation in Cell Fix Solution. 2. Fixed cells after centrifugation. 3. Cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. 4. Cells resuspended in 500 µL of TE-50/100 5. Cell suspension after addition of 1ml of phenol. 6. Cell suspension after vortexing. 7. Incubation in 65°C water bath. 8. Four phases after centrifugation (from bottom to top): blue pellet (if it is green, hot phenol cell lysis was not complete; in this case resuspend again and start from step A4); dark green phenol phase; protein interphase (might be invisible); pink TE-50/100 phase with nucleic acids. 9. Carefully transfer upper TE-50/100 phase into new tube. Use yellow tip. 10. Do not take interphase and phenol phase into the tip. 11. Addition of 300 µl chloroform and 300 µl phenol to TE-50/100-fraction. 12. Homogenous white colored emulsion after vortexing. 13. Three phases after centrifugation (from bottom to top): phenol/chloroform (lower phase); protein interphase; pink TE-50/100 phase (upper phase). This phase should be transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. 14. Repeat steps A9-13 until interphase disappears. Cell lysis by hot phenol Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl of sterile ice-cold 50/100 TE-buffer by vortexing or pipetting (Figure 1.4). Add 1 ml of phenol, vortex and incubate in a water bath preheated at 65 °C for 10 min (Figure 1.5-1.7). Regularly shake probes (3-4 times during 10 min of incubation) to prevent phenol phase separation. Centrifuge samples at top speed (16,000 x g) at 15-20 °C for 10 min. The pellet in the bottom phase should be blue-colored meaning cell lysis is complete (Figure 1.8). Transfer upper aqueous phase to a new Eppendorf tube (Figure 1.9-1.10). Purification of nucleic acids by phenol/chloroform Add 300 µl of TE-saturated phenol and 300 µl of chloroform to the probe (collected aqueous phase) (Figure 1.11). Vortex for 1-2 min and centrifuge at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min (Figure 1.12-1.13). For multiple samples apply multi tube automated vortex (for example, Micro tube mixer MT-400). Transfer upper aqueous phase to a new tube. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times until the interphase (a whitish, denatured protein-containing layer between phenol phase and aqueous phase that contains nucleic acid) disappears completely (Figure 1.14). Precipitation of nucleic acids Add 2-3 volumes of 95% ethanol prechilled at -20-30 °C to a final aqueous phase (~ 1,5 ml of ethanol to ~ 0.5 ml of a probe), stir well and incubate at -20 °C from 2-3 h to overnight. At this stage a probe can be stored for several months under ethanol at -20 °C. Centrifuge at top speed, 4 °C for 10 min, carefully discard liquid. Wash the pellet of nucleic acids with 1 ml of 70% cold ethanol by intensive vortexing. Centrifuge at top speed, 4 °C for 5-15 min and completely remove ethanol by aspiration. It is important to carry on all operations with RNA on ice. Separation of RNA from DNA by LiCl precipitation Add 800 µl of 50/100 TE buffer to the pellet. Incubate for 15 min on ice. Vortex probe 3-4 times to dissolve the pellet completely. Add 200 µl of 10 M LiCl solution and mix by vortexing. Leave probes on ice for 2 h. Centrifuge at top speed, 4 °C, for 15-20 min. Carefully remove supernatant by aspiration. Wash the RNA preparation by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol and intensive vortexing of the pellet. Centrifuge at top speed, 4 °C, for 15 min. Repeat 70% ethanol washing. Carefully remove all ethanol and air-dry the probe(s) at room temperature in a tube rack covered by Saran Wrap. If vacuum drier is used, please, take care not to overdry the pellet, because it will become impossible to solubilize it. Dissolve RNA in 50-100 µl of RNAse-free water. Evaluation of RNA quantity and quality Take 1-2 µl of RNA and check its concentration with Nanodrop spectrophotometer. LiCl does not allow to obtain RNA that are completely free from DNA, but the quality of RNA is usually enough for nothern blot analysis. If necessary, purify RNA sample(s) additionally with DNAse according to the manufacturer instructions. Check RNA quality by agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretically resolved total cyanobacterial RNA is visible as 3 major bands that correspond to 23S, 16S and 5S RNAs. Smear on lines indicate RNA was degraded during steps of isolation (Figure 2). Figure 2. Total RNA samples isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at 1 µg per lane were separated by electrophoresis in 1% non-denaturing agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Typically 3 major (or more) bands corresponded to 23S, 16S and 5S RNAs should be seen. Lanes 1-3 represent isolated total RNA of good quality, and lanes 4-6 with smeared bands demonstrate low quality partly degraded RNA. For northern blotting, RNA should be separated in denaturing formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose or nylon membrane (lanes 7, 8). It is recommended to run two extra lanes of RNA sample (lane 7) and RNA ladder (lane 8), which will be cut off and stained with methylene blue to determine the size and quality of RNA after blotting.."

        "@value": "Phalloidin Staining and Immunohistochemistry of Zebrafish Embryos. Fluorescent conjugated Phalloidin is a stain that allows for visualization of F-actin. In immunohistochemistry, primary antibodies and fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies can be used to visualize subcellular localization and relative amounts of proteins of interest. Here is a protocol for Phalloidin and antibody staining of zebrafish embryos 5 days old and younger.. Fixation and Phalloidin staining: Dechorionate embryos with two pairs of fine forceps. Under a dissecting microscope, pinch an embryo’s chorion using a pair of forceps held in one of your hands. With the forceps in your other hand, pinch the chorion near to the original pinch and gently tear the chorion by separating your hands. Repeat pinching and tearing chorions with forceps until the embryos are dechorionated. Using a pipette pump and glass pipettes, transfer dechorionated embryos into microcentrifuge tubes. Put a maximum of 10 embryos in a single tube. Label the tubes accordingly. Note: A pipette pump and glass pipette tips can be used for all solution additions and removals in this protocol excluding the addition of primary and secondary antibodies. Gently pipetting the embryos up and down in the glass pipette tip with each solution change improves washing and keeps the embryos from sticking together. Remove as much liquid as possible from the microcentrifuge tubes. Wear gloves when working with PFA. Add ~0.5 ml of 4% PFA to each microcentrifuge tube. Place the microcentrifuge tubes containing fixative on their sides at room temperature on a bench rocker (gently rocking) for 4 h or at 4 °C overnight. Orient the tubes perpendicular to the rocking motion such that the embryos rock from side to side in the tube rather than from cap to bottom. Remove the fixative and dispose of it in the appropriate waste container. Rinse the embryos 3 times for 5 min each in ~0.5 ml PBS 0.1% Tween-20®. With each rinse in this protocol, gently resuspend the embryos in the solution to improve rinsing and keep them from sticking together. Remove the last PBS 0.1% Tween-20® rinse and add ~0.5 ml PBS 2% TritonX-100® to each tube to permeabilize the embryos for Phalloidin staining. Lay the tubes containing PBS 2% Trition on their sides and gently rock for 1.5 h at room temperature. Remove the PBS 2% TritonX-100® and use a P20 micropipette to add 19 μl of PBS 2% TritonX-100® to each tube. Use a P20 micropipette to add 1 μl of Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 Phalloidin to each tube (wear gloves when working with Phalloidin). Lay the tubes on their sides and gently rock (if possible) overnight at 4 °C. From this point on, keep tubes in the dark whenever possible (e.g. under a box lid or wrapped in foil). Antibody staining with mono/polyclonal antibodies: Remove Phalloidin from the tubes and add ~0.5 ml of block to each tube. Rock tubes containing block on their sides in the dark for at least 1 h at room temperature. Use micropipettes to add block and primary antibody solutions into each tube to obtain the appropriate primary antibody dilution optimized for zebrafish embryo staining. A 1:100 dilution of primary antibody in block is a good place to start. Primary antibody dilutions can range from 1:10 to 1:5,000. Some antibodies may require additional permeabilization steps (e.g. incubation in methanol or acetone at -20 °C, proteinase treatment) prior to the addition of the primary antibody. Some primary antibodies may not be compatible with Phalloidin staining. Incubate embryos in primary antibody at 4 °C overnight in the dark with tubes on their sides and gently rocking, if possible. Remove the primary antibody dilution and add in ~0.5 ml block. Block embryos with tubes on their sides in the dark and gently rocking for ~8 h at room temperature. Additional rinses with block can be added if necessary to reduce non-specific background staining. Remove block and use micropipettes to add 199 μl of antibody block and 1 μl of the appropriate fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody into each tube. Be mindful of the wavelength of the fluorophore that you used for Phalloidin staining when determining the appropriate secondary antibody to use. Ensure that the secondary antibody used corresponds to whether the primary antibody is monoclonal or polyclonal. Incubate embryos in this secondary antibody dilution overnight at 4 °C in the dark with tubes on their sides and gently rocking, if possible. Remove secondary antibody dilution and store embryos in ~0.5 ml PBS 0.1% Tween-20® in the dark. Additional rinses in PBS 0.1% Tween-20® can be added if necessary to reduce non-specific background staining. Deyolking, Mounting, and Imaging: Manually deyolk embryos in 1x PBS with two deyolking tools. Use a deyolking tool to orient an embryo on its side. Hold the embryo down by inserting the tip of the deyolking tool held in one hand at a location in between the yolk sac and the embryo’s body. Use the deyolking tool in the other hand to ‘cut’ the yolk sac away from the embryo’s body while keeping the other hand stationary. Once the majority of yolk has been removed, use the pins as desired to clean up and remove any additional yolk sac remnants. Suck up and discard the pieces of yolk sac. Repeat deyolking process until all embryos are deyolked. Transfer embryos to 80:20 glycerol:PBS. If embryos become dehydrated upon transfer to 80:20 glycerol:PBS, slow washes in increasing concentrations of glycerol may have to be implemented. For example, 1 h long washes in each of 30:70 glycerol:PBS and 60:40 glycerol:PBS may be necessary before transfer to 80:20 glycerol:PBS. Use one deyolked embryo as a test sample and move it from 1x PBS to 80:20 glycerol:PBS. If the shape of the embryo changes, proceed with the incubations listed above for the rest of the embryos. Dot a glass microscope slide with 4 small dots of vacuum grease such that the dots will hold up the four corners of a square cover slip. Transfer one embryo and two drops of 80:20 glycerol:PBS onto the microscope slide in the middle of the 4 dots of grease. Orient the embryo with a deyolking tool so that it is side mounted and flat. Place the cover slip over the specimen and gently press down on the corners of the cover slip until it is touching the embryo, but not squishing it. Repeat steps C3-6 until all embryos are mounted. Keep your prepared slides in a slide book in the dark at 4 °C until they are imaged. Image your stained zebrafish embryos within ~2 weeks, the sooner the better. Representative images are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Phalloidin staining representative results. (A) Brightfield image of a deyolked, side mounted zebrafish embryo, anterior left, dorsal top. (B) Fluorescence micrograph of the same embryo showing phalloidin 546 staining. (C) Image of the same embryo taken with the 20x objective on a Zeiss Axio Imager running AxioVision software. Phalloidin 546 staining enables visualization of the actin cytoskeleton of skeletal muscle fibers. For representative images of antibody staining, please refer to (Goody et al., 2010). Table 1.

PBMCs are separated from the whole blood by a density gradient centrifugation method using Ficoll Histopaque.. Collect 4 ml of human venous blood sample in heparinised vials (BD biosciences) and mix well by gently inverting the tube several times. Take 4 ml of Ficoll Histopaque in a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Gently layer the blood on the top of Ficoll Histopaque using a 1 ml auto pipette. The layering should be done very slowly that blood and Ficoll Histopaque should stay as two different layers. Centrifuge the tubes (without any delay) for 30 min at 100 x g in 4 °C in a swing-out bucket. Fixed angle rotors also can be used but would require more caution when separating cells in interphase. Aspirate the whitish buffy coat (about 1 ml) (PBMCs) formed in the interphase between histopaque and medium. The cells in interphase need to be aspirated without delay. If the tubes are kept standing for more than 10 min, PBMCs from the interphase will get disturbed and start settling down. Wash (centrifuge in 100 x g for 10 min) twice with 10 ml of sterile PBS or sterile Dulbecco's modified eagle medium. The approximate yield of cells from 4 ml of blood varies between 107-108.."

        "@value": "Colony Immunoblotting Assay for Detection of Bacterial Cell-surface or Extracellular Proteins. This simple protocol describes how to detect antigens from agar-grown bacterial colonies transferred to nitrocellulose using specific antibodies. The protocol is well suitable for detection of bacterial proteins exposed on the cell surface or secreted to the extracellular space and it can be modified also for detection of intracellular proteins. The assay can distinguish bacterial clones with different expression rates (high, medium and low) from colonies that do not express target protein. We used this assay for screening of Mat fimbriae-producing Escherichia coli mutants obtained by mini-Tn5 transposon mutagenesis and immunomagnetic separation (Lehti et al., 2013).. Place identical orientation marks in three asymmetric locations on the exterior wall of two fresh agar plates (e.g. LB agar for Escherichia coli). Be sure to include orientation marks on the bottom plate (i.e. not on the lid). Pick each fresh colony to be tested with a sterile toothpick or pipette tip and make a short streak of about 0.5 cm in length onto the test agar plate and then onto the master agar plate. To keep the colonies in a clear physical order use a grid pattern (see Figure 1) under the plates and streak each colony in an identical position on both plates. A colony density of 100 colonies per plate (9 cm diameter) is optimal and minimizes possibility of cross-contamination between colonies. It is recommended to include a negative and positive control colony onto the plates. Figure 1. A grid template for precise orientation of 100 cell colonies on two agar plates. A single grid with 85 mm in diameter is used for a 90 mm Petri dish (the original picture size 19 cm x 10 cm is suitable for printing). To grow the bacteria, invert the plates and incubate them at an appropriate temperature overnight (e.g. for Escherichia coli at 37 °C). To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, avoid overgrowth and potential formation of satellite colonies. Using two tweezers, place a circular nitrocellulose membrane (82 mm in diameter) carefully and evenly on top of the colonies on the test plate for 10-60 sec. Pre-cool the test plate at 4 °C for approximately 30 min before placing the membrane on its surface so that the agar will not adhere onto the membrane. To ensure contact with the colonies, take care to avoid introducing air bubbles between the membrane and the agar surface. Hold the membrane at opposite edges with two tweezers and bend it slightly, and then allow the curved membrane to make contact with the center of the plate. Finally, lower the sides gently onto the agar surface. To avoid cross-contamination and smearing of colonies, do not reorientate the membrane once it has been applied. Mark the membrane orientation according to the three marks on the test plate by stabbing through the membrane with a sterile 18-gauge needle. Save the master plate in 4 °C for later use. Using tweezers, peel off the membrane from the agar and transfer the membrane colony-side up to a beaker. Pour 100 ml of blocking buffer into beaker. Place the beaker on laboratory shaker (Belly dancer) and shake at speed setting 3-4 at room temperature for 5 min to remove excess of colony material. Decant the blocking buffer. Repeat steps 5a and 5b two more times. Pour 100 ml of blocking buffer into beaker and incubate in blocking buffer for 45 min with gently agitation on laboratory shaker (Belly dancer, speed setting 2-3) to ensure complete blocking of unoccupied protein binding sites. Care should be taken to prevent the membrane from drying out during incubation. Multiple membranes can be placed in a single beaker. Note: If working with intracellular proteins, cells should be lysed before blocking. To lyse the cells, transfer the membrane colony-side up from the test plate to a Petri dish containing a sheet of 3 mm (Whatman 3 MM) paper moistened with 2-3 ml of 10% (w/v) SDS solution. Avoid introducing air bubbles. After 5 min incubation, place the membrane on top of the 3 mm paper saturated with 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl for 5 min. Then, neutralize by incubating two times for 5 min on the 3 mm paper soaked with 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 M NaCl. Finally, place the membrane on top of the 3 mm paper saturated with 2x SSC for 15 min. Transfer the membrane colony-side up to a beaker and continue with the blocking step 5d. Prepare a primary antibody dilution in antibody dilution buffer and transfer the membrane to a Petri dish containing the diluted primary antibody (one membrane per Petri dish). For each 82 mm-diameter membrane, use 7-10 ml of diluted primary antibody. Ensure the membrane is adequately covered with the solution to prevent it from drying out during incubation. The antibody dilution and incubation conditions depend on your primary antibody; please refer to primary antibody datasheet. It is recommended to start with the same conditions used for Western blotting. For optimal results, perform a titration experiment (e.g. 1:100-1:3,000) and optimize the dilution according to the results. A serum dilution of 1:500-1:1,000 (5-10 μl in 10 ml) and incubation for 1 hour with gently agitation at room temperature will normally be sufficient. Wash the membrane three times in 10 ml of washing buffer for 5 min each to remove unbound antibodies. Prepare a secondary antibody dilution in antibody dilution buffer and replace the washing buffer with the diluted secondary antibody. Use 7-10 ml of diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody per 82 mm-diameter membrane. Please refer to secondary antibody datasheet for recommended antibody dilution buffer and recommended antibody dilution. Typically 1:500 to 1:2,000 dilutions of the commercial conjugates are appropriate. Incubate as in step 6. Wash as in step 7. To visualize positive colonies reacting with the primary antibodies, replace the washing buffer with 5-10 ml of BCIP/NBT solution and incubate with gentle agitation at room temperature until the desired color develops (usually 2 to 5 min) or background colour begin to appear. The positive control should be dark purple-coloured (see Figure 2). Figure 2. A representative colony immunoblotting membrane of Mat fimbriae expression in Escherichia coli MG1655-Rif derivatives. Bacteria subjected to mini-Tn5 transposon mutagenesis and enrichment with immunomagnetic particles coated with anti-Mat antibodies (available from previous work (Pouttu et al., 2001)) were grown overnight on LB agar plates at 37 °C, and colonies transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane were left to react with anti-Mat antibodies (a dilution of 1:500) and detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (a dilution of 1:2,000). Colony-represents MG1655-Rif, a negative control for Mat fimbriae expression (Lehti et al., 2013). Colony + indicates IHE3034 matA(A536C) (ptet-matA), a positive control of Mat fimbriae expression (Lehti et al., 2013). Colonies 1 to 4 are candidate Mat-fimbriated MG1655-Rif Tn5 mutants. Stop the reaction by rinsing the membrane several times in distilled water. Allow the membrane to air dry in the dark. Find the desired colonies by matching the colonies on the master plate to the reaction spots in the membrane by using orientation marks. Prepare pure cultures of the reactive colonies onto fresh agar plates.."

        "@value": "Preparation and Immunofluorescence Staining of the Trachea in Drosophila Larvae and Pupae. The Drosophila melanogaster trachea is a branched network of rigid chitin-lined tubes that ramify throughout the body and functions as the fly’s respiratory organ. Small openings at the ends of the tracheal tubes allow gas exchange to occur by diffusion between internal tissues and the exterior environment. Tracheal tubes are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, which secrete chitin and control tube morphology and size. Studies of tracheal development in Drosophila embryos have elucidated fundamental mechanisms of tube morphogenesis and maintenance in vivo, and identified major signaling pathways that regulate these processes (Manning and Krasnow, 1993; Affolter and Shilo, 2000; Zuo et al., 2013; Kerman et al., 2006; Schottenfeld et al., 2010). In recent years, there has been growing interest in the trachea during metamorphosis, when tracheal branches that had served as the respiratory organ in the larva decays and is repaired or replaced by new tracheal tissue arising from committed tracheal progenitor cells, or mature tracheal cells de-differentiated to a progenitor state (Manning and Krasnow, 1993; Sato and Kornberg, 2002; Guha et al., 2008; Guha, and Kornberg, 2005; Weaver and Krasnow, 2008; Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2010; Chen and Krasnow, 2014) forming the adult tracheal by the end of the process. The ongoing decay and tissue formation models aspects of tissue repair and regeneration in other organisms, and has been used to understand how progenitor cells divide and differentiate (Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2010; Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2013), and how they grow out of their niche to replace decaying tissue (Chen and Krasnow, 2014). Here, we present a protocol to dissect, fix, and immunostain tracheal tissue in Drosophila larvae and pupae undergoing metamorphosis. This protocol can be used to immunostain proteins expressed in tracheal tissue, or to amplify signals from weakly expressed fluorescent reporters (as shown in Figure 6). With the appropriate antibodies and genetic reporters, this protocol can be used to visualize decaying larval trachea and the progenitor cells that replace them in a time-course analysis, as well as determine expression of proteins in these cells that may play a role in tissue decay and replacement.. Dissection of larvae and pupae by ventral filleting Pick larvae and pupae of the appropriate age. Tracheal progenitors are activated during the late second-instar (L2) stage and remodel the trachea throughout the third-instar (L3) and pupal stages. The staging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae and pupae is described in (Ashburner, 2005). Young (L1 to early L3 stage) larvae [see Ashburner (2005) for more information on larval staging] will burrow into the food as they feed. To isolate these larvae, scoop out a portion of the food with the spoon end of the spatula and place it into a petri dish filled with PBS. Gently separate the food with the spatula until larvae can be seen floating in the PBS, and then transfer the larvae into a new PBS-filled petri dish with a small paintbrush or a glass Pasteur pipette. Late L3 stage larvae that are about to enter puparium formation will migrate onto the walls of the vial or bottle they are cultured in, and because of this behavior are commonly referred to as wandering L3 larvae. Wet a small paintbrush by dipping briefly in PBS and blot the excess PBS on a KimwipeTM. Gently pick up larvae from the wall of the vessel with the tip of the brush. Dip the tip of the brush with the larvae into a petri dish filled with PBS and move the brush back and forth to allow the larvae to be transferred to the PBS. During the pupal stages, tracheal metamorphosis occurs rapidly, and so it is necessary to obtain pupae of precise age. To do this, locate animals that have just entered pupariation [0 h after puparium formation (APF)]; they should be white, attached to the side of the vessel, and immobile (Ashburner, 2005) (Figure 1A). Gently detach these pupae with a small wet paintbrush and transfer them into a new vial. Set the pupae onto the walls of the vial so that the ventral surface of the animal is attached to plastic (the way they normally attach to the vessel wall). Incubate at 25 °C until the desired time APF has been reached, then gently detach and pick up the pupae with a small wet paintbrush and transfer to a dissection dish. When transferring, be careful not to damage the pupae by putting too much pressure on them. Preparations for dissection. Using forceps pick up insect pins one at a time and insert them vertically tip down into the silicone elastomer layer of the dissection dish to be used. Insert just deep enough that the pins are held in place by the silicone elastomer. This way, pins can be easily retrieved with forceps and moved to where they are needed during dissection. Ventral-filleting larvae, and pupae younger than 12 h APF (before eversion of the head) (see Videos 1 and 2). Video 1. Dissecting larva Video 2. Dissecting pupa younger than 12 h APF Place Petri dishes containing larvae on ice for 5 to 10 min. The cold temperature will slow the larva’s movements and facilitate dissection. Do not leave larvae on ice for more than 45 min. Pupae are immobile and will not need to be exposed to cold temperature prior to dissection. Fill a dissection dish with cold PBS and move the larva or pupa into the dissection dish. With forceps, turn the animal ventral side up, and gently hold it in place using forceps. Locate the posterior (Figure 2A and 3A, white arrows) of the left and right tracheal dorsal trunks, a set of large air-filled tubes running along the anterior-posterior axis on the dorsal side of the animal, and insert a pin between the trunks at the posterior (Figure 2A and 3A, white arrowheads) into the silicone elastomer. Insert another pin (Figure 2A and 3A, black arrowheads) between the dorsal trunks at the anterior end of the animal (Figure 2A and 3A, black arrows). When dissecting larvae, first stretch the animal by pulling on the anterior with forceps, and then insert the second pin just below the pigmented mouthparts. Gently pull up on the ventral epidermis (and cuticle in pupae) with forceps, and carefully insert the bottom blade of the Vannas spring scissors where the posterior pin has been inserted, and slide the blade just under the ventral epidermis. If necessary, enlarge the opening made by the pin by pulling on the epidermis with forceps before inserting the scissor blade. Cut towards the anterior of the animal (Figure 2A and 3A, horizontal dashed lines). Pupae can also be cut from anterior to posterior, although larvae are more easily cut from posterior to anterior. Grasp the edges of the cut epidermis (and cuticle in pupae) with forceps, pull gently to the side and secure with pins (Figure 2B-C and 3B-C; asterisks) so that the epidermis is one flat layer (Figure 2C and 3C). Make additional cuts to the epidermis and cuticle as necessary (Figure 3A vertical dashed lines) to allow the sample to be pinned flat. Be careful to not pin or damage tracheal branches during the process. Remove internal organs by pulling on them with forceps. Cut any terminal tracheal branches attached to the tissue (Figure 2D, arrows) so that the tissue can be removed. The main tracheal branches [as described in Manning and Krasnow (1993)] should now be visible (Figure 2C, E and 3C); they are rigid air-filled tubes and attached to the epidermis. Clear remaining debris and tissue around tracheal branches by gently pipetting PBS onto the sample with a Pasteur pipette. Ventral-filleting pupae older than 12 hours APF (after head eversion) (see Video 3). Video 3. Dissecting pupa older than 12 h APF Pupae that have completed the larval-pupal molt and everted their heads (Figure 1C), which occurs around 12 h APF, need to be removed from the pupal case prior to dissection. To do this, move the pupa onto a dry dissection dish ventral side down. Work under a stereomicroscope, and hold a pair of Dumont #5 forceps in each hand. Carefully hold the pupa with forceps using the non-dominant hand and use forceps in the dominant hand to insert the tip of an insect pin through the posterior end of the pupal case just below where the pupa has detached from the pupal case (Figure 4A, white arrowhead). Continue inserting the pin into the silicone elastomer layer of the dish; the pupa should be securely pinned to the dish. Using Vannas spring scissors make a horizontal cut through both layers of the pupal case at the anterior end above the pupa’s head (Figure 4A, vertical dashed line). Remove the rest of the pupal operculum with forceps. Gently insert scissors just under the pupal case along the anterior-posterior axis (careful not to damage the pupa inside), and cut the pupal case from anterior to the posterior (Figure 4A, horizontal dashed line). Carefully peel away the pupal case and remove it or pin it down to the dish (Figure 4C, asterisks), making extra cuts in the pupal case as necessary to relieve any pressure exerted by the case on the pupa inside. Gently pick up the pupa from the pinned case with a small wet brush and transfer to a new dissection dish. An alternative method to remove the pupa from the pupal case is described in Wang and Yoder (2011). With a wet brush (or very gently with forceps) orient the pupa ventral side up. Gently holding the pupa in place with forceps, insert a pin through the head (Figure 4D, black arrowhead). With forceps, pull up on the ventral epidermis at the opening made by the pin and slide the bottom blade of the Vannas spring scissors just under the ventral epidermis. Cut all the way to the posterior of the animal (Figure 4D, black dashed line). Make a small cut in the dorsal epidermis from posterior to anterior just to the midpoint of the abdomen (Figure 4D, black dotted line). This cut allows the pupa to be pinned flat. Grasp the cut edges of the ventral epidermis with forceps and pin down so that the epidermis is one flat layer (Figure 4E). Much of the internal tissues of the pupa will be histolyzed and can be removed by gently pipetting PBS onto the sample with a Pasteur pipette. Pipetting in the anterior to posterior direction results in least amount of damage to the tracheal branches. Any remaining tissue can be gently pulled out with forceps. Fix the dissected larvae and pupae. Remove the PBS containing detached internal tissues with a P1000 pipet. Gently pipet 1 to 2 ml of 4% PFA along the sides of the dish, enough to cover all of the samples. Place the dissection dish on an orbital shaker in the fume hood. Cover samples with a light protected box if samples express fluorescent proteins. Set the shaker on a medium-low setting (i.e., 3 or 4) and allow the PFA to fix the samples at room temperature for 30 min. Remove the 4% PFA and properly dispose as hazardous waste. Gently pipet 1 to 2 ml room temperature PBS, and shake for 5 minutes to wash out residual PFA. Repeat 2 more times. With forceps and working under the stereomicroscope, carefully remove the pins holding the samples in place. Transfer the fixed samples into a 4-well dish for staining. Up to 6 larvae and 8 pupae can be stained in each well. Proceed with the staining procedure described below or store the samples immersed in PBS at 4 °C with the plate wrapped in Parafilm. Samples can be stored for up to a few weeks. Immunofluorescence staining larval and pupal trachea Permeabilize the fixed sample(s) by incubating in 650 μl PBS with 0.1% TritonTM X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. Pipet in liquids gently along the sides of each well to prevent damaging the samples. If samples express a fluorescent reporter, cover the dish with aluminum foil or a light protected box for this and subsequent steps. Remove the PBS with 0.1% TritonTM X-100, add 650 μl block solution into each well, and incubate at room temperature for 30 min on a Nutator mixer. Dilute primary antibody in block solution. Remove the block solution from the step above and apply 650 μl of the primary antibody solution per well. If amount of the antibody solution needs to be conserved, add just enough to immerse the samples, about 250 μl per well. Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a Nutator mixer. Remove the antibody solution, add 650 μl PBS 0.1% Triton, and incubate on a Nutator mixer for 5 min at room temperature to wash away residual antibodies. Remove wash solution, and repeat 2 more times. Wash the samples 3 more times in 650 μl PBS 0.1% Triton for 30 min each. These longer washing steps are necessary to remove any antibodies that might have been trapped in the tracheal tubes. Dilute fluorescence conjugated secondary antibody in PBS 0.1% Triton, and apply 250 to 650 μl to each well. Incubate on a Nutator mixer for 1 h at room temperature. Cover the dish with aluminum foil or a light protective box for this and subsequent steps. Wash the samples in PBS 0.1% Triton 3 times for 5 min each. Apply 650 μl DAPI staining solution each well and incubate for 10 to 20 min. Remove the DAPI solution, and wash the samples with PBS 0.1% Triton 3 times for 5 min each, and then 3 times for 30 min each. Mount samples on glass slides Cut two pieces of black electrical tape about 20 mm x 5 mm and affix to the glass slide. Leave a space slightly less than the width of the coverslip between the two pieces of tape (Figure 5A). The pieces of tape are used to create a small space between the slide and the coverslip (Figure 5B); if the samples are mounted without the tape, the coverslip may crush the sample and damage tracheal structures. Add two to three drops of Vectashield® mounting media onto the glass slide between the two pieces of tape. Place your samples in the Vectashield® and adjust the orientation of the samples so that the internal surface of the sample containing the tracheal branches is on top and the exterior surface of the epidermis is on the bottom. To facilitate imaging, orient the samples on the slide so that when observing the slide through the microscope the anterior is on the left and the posterior on the right. With forceps, remove any dust particles that might be lodged in the sample. Cover samples with a coverslip and allow the Vectashield® to fill the space between the slide and coverslip, gently push down on the coverslip with forceps if necessary. Remove any extra Vectashield leaking from under the coverslip with a Kimwipe. Apply clear nail polish around the edges of the coverslip to seal in the samples and Vectashield®. Cover the slides with a light protective box, and allow the nail polish to dry at room temperature (approximately 10 min). Proceed with microscopic analysis, or store the slides at 4 °C.."

C2C12 myoblasts are commonly used in biomedical laboratories as an in vitro system to study muscle development and differentiation. This protocol explains the basic procedures of culture, transfection and differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells.. Grow cells from frozen stock Briefly thaw cells in a 37 °C pre-warmed water bath. Once cells are thawed, pipette into Eppendorf tube and spin for 5 min at 1,000 rpm. Aspirate media. Resuspend cells in 10 ml growth media and plate in 100 mm dish. Split the cells when they grow to 80% confluency. Refreeze the cells: freeze the cells in freezing media. Passage cells Once cells reach 80% confluency, split as 1:40 to a new dish. 3-4 days later, it will be 80% confluency again. Never let cells grow confluency. They will differentiate. Transfection Day 0: seed cells (low density, < 50%). Day 1: transfection: (optimum 20% FBS, NO P/S). Day 2: change media (growth media for regular growth or differentiation media for differentiation purpose). 4-5 days for complete differentiation under confluency. 3-4 days for complete differentiation under starvation media, but growth is restricted. Example: For 6-well plate: Seed 100,000-150,000 cells total in all 6 plates (10-15,000/cm2). Transfect 1 μg DNA/6-wells (total).."

        "@value": "ELISA Based Protein Ubiquitylation Measurement. Ubiquitylation is a common post-translational modification of cellular proteins that results in proteasomal and lysosomal degradations. Ubiquitylation is generally measured by methods such as immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibodies after isolating the protein-of-interest by denaturing immunoprecipitation. The following protocol can be used to easily quantify the ubiquitylation of the protein-of-interest tagged with biotin by ELISA.. Lysate preparation from BHK cells expressing Biotin-tagged CFTR Prepare confluent BHK cells (negative control) and BHK cells expressing Biotin-tagged target protein (e.g., HBH-∆F508-CFTR-3HA) on a 60 mm dish. Incubate with inhibitors (e.g., 10 μM MG-132) for 3 h at 37 °C to accumulate the ubiquitylation. Lyse cells with 1 ml of lysis buffer (Recipe 3) on ice. Centrifuge (14,000 x g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer 1 ml of supernatant to a fresh tube and place on ice for immediate assay or store at -80 °C for future usage. Biotin-tagged CFTR immobilization on NeutrAvidin coated 96-well plate Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) (Recipe 4). Block the plate with the Blocking buffer (100 μl/well) (Recipe 5) for 15-30 min on ice. Add the cell lysate to the plate according to Figure 2. Note: Add 50-150 μl/well of cell lysate depending on the desired signal for detection. It is essential to optimize the amount of cell lysate to obtain enough, but not saturated signals by the protein-of-interest. Prepare triplicate or quadruplicate samples for both CFTR and Ub detection. Negative control using cell lysate from BHK cells not expressing HBH-CFTR-3HA is necessary to measure the background signal. Figure 2. Assay template for ELISA based protein ubiquitylation measurement with negative control and two samples of HBH-∆F508 CFTR-3HA in BHK cells. Cell lysate from BHK cells not expressing HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA is used as a negative control to measure the background signal. BHK cells stably expressing HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA were treated with 10 μM MG-132 for 3 h at 37 °C before the cell lysis. Incubate for 2 h at 4 °C. Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) once. Note: If the target protein tends to aggregate, add detergent in all the steps. Add Denaturing buffer (100 μl/well) (Recipe 6) and incubate for 5 min at RT (Room Temperature). Wash the plate with the Urea wash buffer (400 μl/well) (Recipe 7) for 5 times. Detection of the CFTR ubiquitylation by ELISA Block the CFTR-immobilized plate with the Blocking buffer (100 μl/well) for 20 min at RT. Add the primary antibody (50 μl/well) diluted with Blocking buffer according to Figure 2, and incubate for 1 h at RT. Note: For the primary antibody, the following conditions may work: Anti-Lys48 specific ubiquitin antibody (Apu2) (1:500); Anti-Lys63 specific ubiquitin antibody (Apu3) (1:500). Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) 4 times. Add 50 μl/well of the secondary antibody diluted with the Blocking buffer according to Figure 2, and incubate for 45-60 min at RT. Note: For the secondary antibody, the following conditions may work: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000); HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) 6 times. Add SuperSignalTM West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (100 μl/well) and incubate for 5 min at RT. Read the luminescence signal by SkanItTM software in Varioskan® Flash plate reader (Figure 3). The CFTR ubiquitylation level quantified by the anti-Ub antibody is normalized for the CFTR level quantified by the anti-HA antibody (Figure 4). Note: For normalization by the target protein, measure the amount of immobilized protein. If the target protein’s signal is too strong, reduce the amount of cell lysate to prevent the saturation of the signal. Figure 3. Protocol in SkanItTM software. The luminescence signal is measured by the Varioskan® Flash plate reader with the SkanItTM software. The protocol consists of 3 steps (boxed in red). 1st step is shaking the plate for 5 s. 2nd step is incubation (Pause) for 3 min. 3rd step is the luminescence measurement in a second. Figure 4. A typical result of the HBH-∆F508 CFTR-3HA ubiquitylation in BHK cells by ELISA according to Figure 2. A. The amount of HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA immobilized on the NeutrAvidin plate (8 μg/well cell lysate) was measured using anti-HA antibody. B-C. The amount of K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (B) (80 μg/well cell lysate) and K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (C) (80 μg/well cell lysate) on the immobilized CFTR was measured using anti-K48-Ub and anti-K63-Ub antibodies, respectively. D-E. The amount of K48-linked poly-ubiquitylation (D) and K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation (E) of HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA was quantitated after the normalization for the CFTR level quantified by the anti-HA antibody.. Protein ubiquitylation facilitates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations of misfolded proteins such as ∆F508 CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), resulting in the genetic disease, Cystic Fibrosis. In addition, protein ubiquitylation regulates selective autophagy, receptor endocytosis, and intracellular signal transductions. K48-linked poly-ubiquitylation and K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation facilitates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations, respectively. Therefore, quantitative analysis of protein ubiquitylation and specific poly-ubiquitin chain configurations of the protein-of-interest present as significant information in understanding the ubiquitylation-mediated processes.Immunoblot detection of immunoprecipitated proteins is a commonly used technique to analyze protein ubiquitylation. This technique has an advantage in measuring the ubiquitylation of endogenous proteins; however, it is immensely demanding and time-consuming with relatively low sensitivity. In contrast, the ELISA-based ubiquitylation assay is simple and can easily quantitate the ubiquitylation levels of the protein-of-interest tagged with biotin when compared to immunoblot detection (Okiyoneda et al., 2018). The protein biotinylation can be achieved by introducing an HB (histidine-biotin) tag (Tagwerker et al., 2006) or AviTagTM on the protein-of-interest. The biotinylated protein can be easily immobilized on streptavidin or NeutrAvidin-coated 96 well plates and denatured by urea to dissociate the interacting proteins. We prefer NeutrAvidin-coated 96 well plates in this protocol due to NeutrAvidin which has a higher affinity and specificity against the biotin-tag compared to streptavidin. The ubiquitin (Ub) chains conjugated to the protein-of-interest can be quantitated by ELISA using anti-Ub antibodies, including poly-ubiquitin chain specific antibodies. Few ubiquitin ELISA kits are commercially available (e.g., UbiQuantTM quantitative ubiquitin ELISA from LifeSensors) and few ubiquitin-related ELISA methods are published as well (Conte et al., 2017). These published ELISAs use antibodies to immobilize ubiquitin or substrate proteins on multi-well plates. For some substrate proteins, the suitable antibody for the immobilization may be unavailable. In contrast, our method uses the interaction between Neutravidin and biotin in order to immobilize the biotinylated substrate proteins on multi-well plates. The interaction between Neutravidin and biotin exhibits the highest known affinity with high specificity. Moreover, it can withstand the presence of denaturing agents (e.g., 2 M urea), which dissociates the substrate-binding proteins, which may also be ubiquitinated. Thus, our method is advantageous over the other methods due to the unnecessary use of antibodies for the immobilization and specific detection of the substrate ubiquitination. The ELISA-based ubiquitylation assay potentially detects ubiquitylation of endogenous proteins genetically introduced with an HB tag or AviTagTM by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Through this protocol, we use the BHK cells stably expressing HBH (histidine-biotin-histidine) -∆F508 CFTR-3HA which were generated as previous work (Okiyoneda et al., 2018) while the ubiquitylation of ∆F508 CFTR tagged with an HBH tag can be measured by ELISA."

        "@value": "Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) Activity Assay Protocols for Caenorhabditis elegans. Assays for superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities are widely employed to indicate antioxidant responses underlying the toxic effects of test chemicals. Yet, earlier studies mainly described the procedures as performed according to manufacturer’s instructions without modifications that are specific to any organisms. The present protocol describes the steps in analyzing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in C. elegans, which is a model organism that can be used to study effects of pharmaceutical compounds and environmental pollutants. The main steps include: (1) sample preparation; (2) total protein assay; (3) SOD activity assay; (4) CAT activity assay; and (5) medium list and formula, and also data analysis and performance notes.. Sample preparation Sample collection The entire protocol uses the L4 stage nematodes as the reference point. Follow the nematode culture and age-synchronization according to earlier reports (Solis and Petrascheck, 2015; Yu et al., 2017). Wash the L4 stage nematodes off each nematode growth medium plate (60 mm) with 1.6 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. After a 30-min settlement by gravity at 4 °C, carefully pipette out and discard the supernatants. Add 500 μl ice-cold PBS, resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting followed by a further 15-min settlement. Then, discard the supernatants, add 500 μl ice-cold PBS, resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting and obtain groups with 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 nematodes in 200 μl PBS in the centrifuge tubes using the following steps. Take the group with 100 nematodes as an example. Count the nematodes in 20 μl PBS under a microscope with three independent trials to estimate the nematode density in the whole tube. Based on the number of worms obtained, calculate and adjust the volume of PBS so that the final density is ~9 to 11 worms per 20 μl. For example, if the number is more than 10, add more PBS accordingly; and if the number is less than 10, perform a 10-min settlement and remove corresponding amount of PBS to achieve the desired density. Transfer 260 μl PBS with the nematodes into new 1.5 ml tubes with pipette, and resuspend the pellets with gentle and repetitive pipetting. Count nematode numbers in 20 μl PBS in three independent trials, with gentle and repetitive pipetting in between, to confirm the nematode density, leaving 200 μl in the tube. If the nematode density is not consistent with the setting, repeat step A1b. Prepare groups with other nematode numbers through the same way. Sample storage Centrifuge the tubes at 5,000 x g for 5 min (4 °C). Discard the supernatant PBS carefully with pipette and store the pellets at -26 °C overnight or -80 °C for over a week. Sample homogenization Connect a clean pestle with the motor-driven tissue grinder. Wash the pestle in ice-cold PBS, and clean it with the absorbent paper. Push the pestle tightly against the pellets in the 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Keep the centrifuge tube in an ice bucket (see Figure 1). Start the tissue grinder, grind the pellets for 10 sec with a 2-sec cooling down followed by another 10-sec grinding. Then, use 200 μl ice-cold PBS to wash the residual liquids on the pestle back to the centrifuge tube (see Figure 1), before taking it out of the tube. Centrifuge the tubes at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pipette out 200 μl supernatants from each sample. Aliquot them into four tubes with 50 μl in each for subsequent determination. Figure 1. Sample homogenization. The left picture shows that motor-driven tissue grinder homogenizes the pellets in the centrifuge tube in an ice bath, and the right one shows that residual liquids are washed off the pestle with 200 μl ice-cold PBS. Total protein assay Measure the total protein (TP) in each sample by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits based on BCA methods. Preparation for protein standards Use the stock protein standard (5 mg/ml) to prepare 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 mg/ml dilutions, 100 μl each using PBS. Preparation for BCA working solution Prepare BCA working solution with BCA reagent A and B by a volume ratio of 50:1. Total volume of the BCA working solution is calculated according to the amount of tested samples (200 μl per sample). Determination of protein concentration For each protein standard, add 20 μl into a 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Use 20 μl PBS buffer as control. For each nematode sample, add 20 μl from one aliquot into the 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Use up this aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples. Then, add 200 μl BCA working solution per well for all the protein standards and nematode samples. Seal the wells by sealing tape to avoid the evaporation of water, and incubate the plate for 30 min at 37 °C. Measure the absorbance at 562 nm (A562) using a microplate reader. Data calculation Calculate the protein contents in the samples according to the standard curve. One presentation of the relation between the nematode numbers and the protein concentrations is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The relationship between the nematode numbers and the nematode protein concentrations SOD activity assay Measure the SOD in each sample by ELISA kits based on WST-8 method. The WST-8 method is based on the colorimetric reaction of WST-8. In the reaction, xanthine oxidase (XO) catalyzes the oxidation conversion of xanthine to yield superoxide anion, which quenches WST-8 to produce water-soluble formazan (a purple dye). As SOD quenches superoxide anion, thus its activity inhibits the overall colorimetric reaction (see Figure 3). Therefore, the inhibition levels are used to indicate the SOD activities in cells, tissues or other biological samples. Figure 3. The colorimetric reaction of WST-8 with the superoxide anion from xanthine, and the SOD activities inhibit the colorimetric reaction Preparation of necessary solution Prepare the standards and controls, and working solutions according to the manufacturer’s instruction of the ELISA kit. Each sample needs 160 μl WST-8/enzyme working solution and 20 μl reaction initiation solution. Calculate the total amount according to the number of nematode samples plus standards. For WST-8/enzyme working solution, 160 μl consists of 151 μl SOD detection buffer, 8 μl WST-8 and 1 μl enzyme solution. Prepare the reaction initiation solution, by diluting from the original stock 1:40 in SOD detection buffer (i.e., 1 μl original solution to 39 μl buffer). Determination of samples Add 20 μl standards and controls into a 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Add 20 μl nematode samples into the 96-well plate with at least two replicates. Notably, each nematode sample is processed and divided into 4 aliquots after the step of sample homogenization. Use up one aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples. Use a multi-channel pipette to add 160 μl WST-8/enzyme working solution into each sample, and then, add 20 μl reaction initiation working solution. The concentrations of standards are 100, 50, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 and 0.625 U/ml. There are two blank controls. For the blank control 1, 20 μl sample are replaced by SOD detection buffer. For the blank control 2, 20 μl sample and 20 μl reaction initiation solution are replaced by 40 μl SOD detection buffer. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 37 °C. Read the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) by a microplate reader. Calculation in SOD activity assay Inhibition (%) = (ABlank control 1 - AStandard or Sample)/(ABlank control 1 - ABlank control 2) x 100%. Use the standards with known SOD activities and their inhibitions to establish a standard curve. Then, use the curve to calculate the SOD activities of samples by their inhibitions. One example for the standard curve is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. The relationship between SOD activities in logarithm and inhibition (%) on WST-8 colorimetric reaction Express the SOD enzyme activity in each nematode sample as its proportion (P) in the total protein (TP) of the same sample to eliminate the differences of nematode numbers among samples. The normalized SOD activities in the nematodes are listed in Table 1. The proportion values generally range from 4.04 to 4.35. The values in groups with 20 and 50 nematodes are quite greater than the general range. Although these values are within mean value + 3 standard deviation (SD), we recommend not using them to avoid unreliability. These results indicate that at least 100 nematodes should be used to ensure the feasibility and stability in measuring SOD activities. Table 1. Connection between normalized SOD activities and nematode numbers CAT activity assay Measure the CAT activities in each sample with ELISA kits. The assay principle is based on the reaction of catalase to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The excess H2O2 can form complexation with ammonium molybdate to produce light yellow solution. The solution’s adsorption at 450 nm can be used to calculate the concentration of H2O2 and therefore to indirectly indicate the CAT activities. Reagents preparation According to the manufacturer’s instruction of the ELISA kit, prepare all reagents before the assay with careful calculation based on the numbers of samples, standards and controls. Addition of standards or samples Add 50 μl standards or samples into a 96-well plate. Use 50 μl PBS as blank controls. All standards, samples and controls are recommended to have at least two replicates. Notably, each nematode sample is processed and divided into 4 aliquots after the step of sample homogenization. Use up one aliquot to ensure replicate and avoid repetitive freezing-unfreezing of the samples. The concentrations of standards are 400, 100, 25, 6.25, 1.5625, 0.4 and 0.1 U/L. Enzyme conjugation Add 100 μl of enzyme conjugate to wells containing standards, samples and blanks. Then, seal the wells by sealing tape to avoid the evaporation of water, and incubate the microplate statically for 60 min at 37 °C. Wash Discard the liquid content and tap the assay plate on a piece of absorbent paper to remove residual buffer. Add 350 μl wash solution (1x, which was diluted from the 40x package with PBS) to each well and keep the microplate static for 1 min. Then, discard the liquid content and tap the assay plate on a piece of absorbent paper to remove residual buffer. Repeat the above wash process for four times. Addition of substrates Use a multi-channel pipette to add 50 μl substrate A and 50 μl substrate B to each well. Incubate the microplate at 37 °C in the dark for 15 min. Endpoint measurement Add 50 μl stop solution to each well. After 1 min incubation, measure the absorbance at 450 nm on a microplate reader within 15 min. Data calculation and presentation Calculate the total CAT activities of samples according to the standard curve (see Figure 5), the method of which is similar to that used by the SOD activity assay. Figure 5. The relationship between total CAT activities in logarithm and inhibition (%) on colorimetric reaction between H2O2 and ammonium molybdate Express the CAT activities in each nematode sample as its proportion (P) in the total protein (TP) of the same sample to eliminate the differences of nematode numbers among samples. The normalized CAT activities in the nematodes are listed in Table 2. The proportion values generally range from 8.74 to 10.36. The values in groups with 20 and 50 nematodes are significantly greater than this range. These results indicate that at least 100 nematodes should be used to ensure the feasibility and stability in measuring CAT activities. Table 2. Connection between normalized CAT activities and nematode numbers. Biomarkers are essential to examine biological and pathogenic processes in response to a chemical, an agent or a therapeutic intervention. Various biological processes in organisms result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause oxidative stress. In response to such oxidative stress, organisms can deploy superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to scavenge ROS so as to protect the cellular homeostasis (Balaban et al., 2005). On the one hand, various chemicals (pollutants) can retard such antioxidant responses, and disturb the health of organisms including human beings. On the other hand, many pharmaceuticals aim to strengthen the antioxidant responses to improve health. Therefore, activities of SOD and CAT are very important to reflect potential effects of chemicals or/and pharmaceuticals.Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a model organism that has been used to study effects of pharmaceutical compounds (Dengg and van Meel, 2004; Carretero et al., 2017) and environmental pollutants (Yu et al., 2013a and 2017). Several studies have used SOD and CAT assays to indicate the antioxidant responses and potential mechanism underlying the toxic effects of test chemicals (Feng et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2012; 2016 and 2017). However, these studies simply described that the determination was carried out, by using a generic kit protocol without species-specific modifications. Therefore, the explicit protocols to perform SOD and CAT assays in C. elegans are still needed for better specific instruction.In the present protocol, we provide a nematode protocol with experimental details to analyze SOD and CAT activities in C. elegans."

        "@value": "In vitro Protein Kinase Assay Using Yeast Sch9. This protocol will describe experimental procedures for an in vitro kinase assay of the yeast protein kinase Sch9. This protocol can be tailored to detect kinase activity of other yeast protein kinase.. Inoculate W303a wild type or W303a cells containing vector, pRS315-SCH9-HA3 and its kinase dead form (K441A) and hyperactive form (2D3E) overnight in 10 ml SC-His- medium. Shaking vigorously (300 rpm) at 30 °C. Subculture yeast cells in 2 flasks containing 100 ml YPD each with starting OD600=0.2. Shake vigorously at 30 °C to OD600=0.5 (important to use YPD rather than SD medium). Add to one flask 200 nM of rapamycin and another vehicle control. Shake vigorously at 30 °C for 30 min. Spin down at room temperature (RT) at 3,000 x g to collect cells (It is important to avoid freezing). Discard most of the supernatant, then suspend yeast cells in the remaining medium and split into 5x 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (20 ml cell culture/tube, more cells in one tube do not breakdown sufficiently). Collect cell pellets, immediately add 200 µl ice-cold IP buffer and the same amount of glass beads. Immediately breakdown cells by beads beater at 4 °C for 1 min. Note: Do not exceed 3 min, otherwise kinase activity will begin to decrease due to overheating. 15 sec x 5 beating with 45 sec in between also decreases Sch9 kinase activity. Collect cell lysate by spinning down at 20,000 x g, 10 min at 4 °C. Combine lysate. Immediately add 1 µg HA antibody (12CA5) to 1 mg/500 μl cell lysate, gently rotate at 4 °C for 1 h. Wash protein A/G beads 3x with IP buffer. Add 50 μl (100 μl 50% slurry) to cell lysate and further rotate for another 1 h. Spin down and collect beads. Wash 3x with 0.5 ml ice-cold IP buffer. Add 0.5 ml 1x with ice-cold kinase buffer. Save 50 µl in another 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for western blot with HA antibody. Spin down and add to the immunocomplex 100 µM ATP, 0.5 µg bacterially-expressed GST-Maf1 in 50 µl kinase. Add to the reaction system 50 µCi [γ-32P]-ATP. Vortex and incubate at 30 °C for 15-30 min. Kinase reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 2.5x SDS loading dye. Half of the sample should be subjected to SDS-PAGE. Substrate will be detected by Coomassie blue staining. Dry the gel using gel dryer at 80 °C for 2 h. Phosphorylation of substrate is revealed by authoradiograph.."

        "@value": "Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide Perfusion Blocks Gene Expression of Synaptic Plasticity-related Proteins without Inducing Compensation in Hippocampal Slices. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity has been hindered by both the compensation that can occur after chronic loss of the core plasticity molecules and by ex vivo conditions that may not reproduce in vivo plasticity. Here we describe a novel method to rapidly suppress gene expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) applied to rodent brain slices in an “Oslo-type” interface chamber. The method has three advantageous features: 1) rapid blockade of new synthesis of the targeted proteins that avoids genetic compensation, 2) efficient oxygenation of the brain slice, which is critical for reproducing in vivo conditions of long-term synaptic plasticity, and 3) a recirculation system that uses only small volumes of bath solution (< 5 ml), reducing the amount of reagents required for long-term experiments lasting many hours. The method employs a custom-made recirculation system involving piezoelectric micropumps and was first used for the acute translational blockade of protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) synthesis during long-term potentiation (LTP) by Tsokas et al., 2016. In that study, applying antisense-ODN rapidly prevents the synthesis of PKMζ and blocks late-LTP without inducing the compensation by other protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that occurs in PKCζ/PKMζ knockout mice. In addition, we show that in a low-oxygenation submersion-type chamber, applications of the atypical PKC inhibitor, zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) can result in unstable baseline synaptic transmission, but in the high-oxygenation, \"Oslo-type\" interface electrophysiology chamber, the drug reverses late-LTP without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. This comparison reveals that the interface chamber, but not the submersion chamber, reproduces the effects of ZIP in vivo. Therefore, the protocol combines the ability to acutely block new synthesis of specific proteins for the study of long-term synaptic plasticity, while maintaining properties of synaptic transmission that reproduce in vivo conditions relevant for long-term memory.. Assembly of the Micropump Control Circuit For a simplified schematic with color-coded cables refer to Figure 2A. For detailed, step-by step photos of the assembly of the circuit, consult Figures 4-14. For a table listing all the connections required for the mp6 micropump control circuit, see Figure 3. Figure 3. Table listing all the breadboard connections required for the mp6 micropump control circuit Figure 4. Steps 1-4 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. To fit all the necessary components, a breadboard with 3 terminal strips and 63 rows of 10 tie points per terminal strip is required (Figure 4). Such breadboards include the Digilent 340-002-1 or the Wisher WBU-206. Each of these has 5 power distribution buses and 3 terminal strips. Remove (unscrew) the rightmost distribution bus and the adjacent terminal strip. Attach with screws or Velcro pads the two Arduinos–ideally in a staggered fashion to allow easy access to the two USB ports, as shown in Figure 4. Connect the 5 Volt DC Power Supply to the horizontal distribution bus of the breadboard (Figure 4, designated by the red “plus” and the black “minus” signs). Include a simple toggle SPST push button “master switch” (not shown), for switching the power supply to the circuit. Connect the power and ground of all vertical distribution buses to 5 V and ground, respectively, of the horizontal distribution bus (Figure 4) Figure 5. Steps 5-6 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. On the middle (now rightmost) terminal strip attach the two 10K-Ohm potentiometers, and connect them to power and ground, as shown in Figure 5. Note: The screws that rotate the wiper and vary the resistance in each potentiometer should be facing away from each other, therefore allowing enough clearance for the mini screwdriver that will be used to make adjustments in Step 6. Using a mini screwdriver, adjust voltage to get 1.3 V across the wiper of the top potentiometer and 1.8 V across the bottom. Note: For safety, you should disconnect the power supply when proceeding with the next steps of the protocol. Figure 6. Steps 7-8 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. On the terminal strip that includes the two potentiometers also install the two 8-channel logic level converters (Figure 6). Connect VCCB on each logic level converter to 5 V and GND to ground (Figure 6; also refer to Figure 2A for pinout diagram and voltage information). Connect VCCA and OE on the top logic level converter to 1.3 V and on the bottom converter to 1.8 V (see gray jumper wires in Figures 6; also refer to Figure 2A for voltage and pin information). Attach the 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. Use the shield stacking headers to elevate the Breakout Board, and therefore allow enough clearance for the third and fourth mp6-OEM controllers that will be attached next (Step 10) and are directly adjacent to the Breakout Board (see Figure 15D). Figure 7. Steps 9-14 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect the six mp6-OEM controllers to the leftmost terminal strip of the breadboard as shown in Figure 7 (also refer to Figure 2A). Note: The bottom two mp6-OEM controllers will supply the inflow lines (perfusing the top and bottom sides of the mesh) of the bath of the interface chamber, and their flow rate is adjustable by the bottom Arduino Uno, which is connected to Pin 2 (Cyan, added in Step 22) (Figure 2, and Figures 15A and 15B). The top four OEMs are connected to the four-pump array that supplies the suction (Figure 15C), and their flow rate is constant (set at maximal). For these OEMs, Pin 2 and Pin 3 are shorted and do not receive any input from the bottom Arduino Uno (Figure 2A). Also notice that in all six of the OEMs Pin 5 and Pin 10 are unused. Short Pins 11 and 12 on all six mp6-OEMs, using U-shaped loops made out of cut jumper wires, long enough to connect two contacts on adjacent breadboard rows (see six-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins). Similarly, short Pins 2 and 3 of the top four OEMs (see five-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins). Connect the ground (Black) to Pin 1, marked with a white spot of all six mp6-OEMs (Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins). Connect 5 V (Red) to Pin 14 of all six mp6-OEMs, as shown in Figure 7 (refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins). Figure 8. Step 15 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect 1.3 V (Yellow), from A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 of the top logic level converter, to Pin 4 of all six mp6-OEMs (Figure 8; only two such connections are shown in the schematic of Figure 2A). Figure 9. Step 16 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect 1.8 V (Orange), from A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 of the bottom logic level converter, to Pin 13 of all six mp6-OEMs. (Figure 9; only two such connections are shown in the schematic of Figure 2A). Figure 10. Steps 17-18 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect Pin 6 (Brown) to Pins Left 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 10). Connect Pin 7 (Green) to Pins Left 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 10). Figure 11. Steps 19-20 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect Pin 8 (Blue) to Pins Right 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 11). Connect Pin 9 (Purple) to Pins Left 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout (Figure 11). Figure 12. Step 21 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect Inputs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 of the top logic level converter to Digital Pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively, of the top Arduino Uno, as shown in Figure 12 (White cables). Figure 13. Step 22 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect Inputs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 of the bottom logic level converter to Digital Pins 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, respectively, of the top Arduino Uno, as shown in Figure 13 (Magenta cables). Figure 14. Step 23 and complete overview of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details. Connect Outputs 9 and 10 (PWM0 and PWM1) of the bottom Arduino Uno to Pin 2 (Cyan) of the bottom two OEMs (Figure 14). Connect one of the Digital outputs of the ADC to TX 1 and GDN of the top Arduino Uno (Figure 2A). This connection will turn on and off the recirculation perfusion controlled by the mp6 pumps, as directed by the winLTP Program. Connect the two Arduino Uno units to the computer, using USB connection. Connect the GDN of the bottom Arduino to the central ground of the electrophysiology rig. (Figure 2A. The top Arduino is grounded via the ADC ground—see Step 24). Copy and load into the top Arduino controlling all six micropumps (Microcontroller 1) the program shown in Figure 18. Copy and load into the bottom Arduino controlling the two inflow micropumps (Microcontroller 2) the program shown in Figure 19. Assembly of the mp6 micropump array (see reference 29) Assemble the six cables connecting the six Molex connectors (one per mp6 micropump) to the Breakout Board 26-pin ribbon cable, as shown in Figures 2B and 15E. The color scheme of Figures 2B and 2C serves as a guide. Use four male gold-plated pins and a 32AWG 4-wire multi-conductor cable (e.g., the MC001 Alpha Wire Multi-Conductor Cable) to connect the four pins of the Molex connector to the ribbon cable. Each Molex connector and associated multicolor cable will be inserted into four sockets of the ribbon cable (wire arrangement, clockwise from top left socket: brown, purple, blue, green; repeat for all six Molex connectors). Only 24 (6 x 4) out of the 26 sockets of the ribbon cable will be used. Note: Disregard the colors of the Alpha Wire multicolor cables in Figures 15A, 15B, 15C, 15E and 15F, which are unrelated to the color scheme of Figure 2B. Position both components as indicated in Figure 2C, the mp6/mp6-pp facing upwards (with its company logo and serial number markings visible from above), and the Molex connector with the four small openings facing down. Then slide the mp6/mp6-pp flex into the Molex connector. Clamp the Molex connector to complete the connection between both components. Manufacture three custom-made plexiglass spacers similar to the ones shown in Figures 15A and 15B. Also prepare cork pads cut to size in order to compensate for differences in the thickness of the micropump and the Molex connectors. Make an assembly consisting of two mp6 micropumps as shown in Figures 15A (front) and 15B (side) as follows: First, glue the marked side of micropump 1 (mp6-1) on the plexiglass spacer using double-sided adhesive tape. Glue cork pads to the unmarked side of the first micropump. The order of parts in the resulting component is: plexiglass/mp6-1/cork. Repeat these steps for micropump 2 (mp6-2), but in the opposite order, i.e., with the cork pad glued to marked side and the plexiglass spacer on the unmarked. The order of parts in the resulting component is: cork/mp6-2/plexiglass. Build a four mp6 micropump assembly (Figure 15C) consisting of the two plexiglass spacer/mp6/cork pad components, by placing the third (unglued) plexiglass spacer in between, so that order of parts in the completed array is: plexiglass/mp6-1/cork/plexiglass/cork/mp6-2/plexiglass. The resulting assembly can be held together either with pieces of double-sided adhesive tape, or by a clamp, or with long screws that pass through drilled holes into the plexiglass spacers. In the latter case, make sure to tap threads into the holes of only one out of the three spacers. Make mini-Faraday cages out of copper wire mesh (Figure 15F) to allow the elimination of the noise generated by the piezoelectric micropumps (see Note 3). Ground the mini Faraday cages on the main ground of the airtable. The completed assemblies consist of either two or four mp6 micropumps (Figure 15F). As discussed above, four pumps connected in parallel are required for the suction, and two pumps with independent inlets and outlets perfuse the top and bottom of the hippocampal slice, from both sides of the mesh in the recording chamber. Figure 15. Different views of the assembled micropump arrays and associated components. A and B. Two mp6 micropumps are stacked in parallel connection, which causes their volume flows to summate. Each such “sandwich” array consists of three custom-made plexiglass panels, one of which is threaded so that screws can hold the assembly together. Cork pads cut to size allow for precise contact of different surfaces. C. Two assemblies shown in (A) and (B) stacked on top of each other, constitute the pump array that controls the suction. Notice the y connectors and mp-cv valves. D. The 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board is connected to 26-pin shield stacking headers with longer pins, so as to allow enough clearance for two of the mp6-OEM controllers that are attached directly adjacent to it. E. Cable that connects six micropumps to the Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. F. Mini-Faraday cages made of copper wire mesh to allow grounding the noise from the pumps. Note: Alpha Wire multiconductor cables have their own color scheme which is unrelated to the color scheme of Figures 2B, 2C, 9 and 11. Part II: Rodent Hippocampal Slice Preparation Prepare Dissection and Recording Solutions: Prepare two stock 10x ACSF solutions, one for dissection (Dissection 10x ACSF) and one for recording (Recording 10x ACSF). Maintain the two stock 10x ACSF solutions at 4 °C until the day of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, prepare 1x Dissection ACSF and 1x Recording ACSF. Oxygenate both solutions for at least 20 min at room temperature with 95% O2/5% CO2. Reducing the temperature of the slice helps prevent ischemic damage (see Note 2). To rapidly chill room-temperature 1x Dissection ACSF Buffer to an appropriate cold temperature without freezing the buffer, place it into a -70 °C freezer for 45 min. If ice crystals form, remove them with a small spoon or sieve to avoid contact with, and possible damage to the brain tissue. After removing from the freezer continue to oxygenate the Dissection ACSF with 95% O2/5% CO2 at 4 °C. Prepare the interface electrophysiology rig: Heat the water jacket of the interface chamber so that the temperature of the recording chamber is 31.5 °C. Preheat 250-500 ml of the 1x Recording ACSF by placing it in a 32 °C water bath while oxygenating with 95% O2/5% CO2. The purpose of preheating the solution to a temperature slightly above the temperature of the recording chamber is to prevent the formation of bubbles in the tubes and under the mesh when the solution is heated again after passing from the heat jacket. Start perfusing the bath with 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 μl/min. Deeply anesthetize the animal in the anesthesia chamber, using an Isoflurane vaporizer: Apply 100% O2 for 2 min, followed by 100% O2 + 1.5% Isoflurane for 1 min, followed by 100% O2 + 2.5% Isoflurane for 2 min. When the animal is deeply anesthetized, decapitate it with a small animal guillotine. Submerge the decapitated head inside a metal surgical tray sitting on ice in an icebox and filled with oxygenated ice-cold 1x Dissection ACSF. Note: Following the decapitation of the animal, the preparation of the brain slices should be completed within less than 10 min. Quickly remove the brain: expose the skull by making an incision with a single edge razor blade on the scalp. Using a pair of surgical scissors with their sharp pointed blade working along the inner side of the skull, cut along the sagittal suture from the foramen magnum to the forehead. Using the surgical scissors, make one cut at the foramen magnum on each temporal side of the skull, then cut across the frontal bone along the coronal suture. Carefully pry the skull open with a rongeur and expose the brain. Holding the skull upside down, sever the cranial nerves that hold the brain to the skull using a spatula and allow the brain to fall into a 50 ml beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Using an icebox, transfer the beaker with the brain to a 4 °C cold room. Isolate the hippocampus: use a 90 mm Pyrex Culture Petri Dish covered with a moistened filter paper as a dissecting platform. Place the chilled brain on the platform and bisect it along the longitudinal fissure. Place the right hemibrain in a 50 ml beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. To isolate the hippocampus of the left hemibrain, sever what remains of the midbrain and brain-stem using a flat spatula. Scoop out the thalamus to expose the ventral face of the hippocampus nested inside the cortex and clearly visible as a curved structure. Sever the septal and temporal connections of the hippocampus from the cortex with a spatula. Using a filled plastic Pasteur pipet, gently squeeze a few droplets of ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF into the pocket of the lateral ventricle to distinguish the border of the fimbria. Gently insert into the lateral ventricle a fine brush moistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF and roll the hippocampus out gently from the surrounding cortex. Isolate the peeled-out hippocampus by cutting it free from the cortex using a flat spatula. Place the left hippocampus in a 20 ml beaker with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Repeat previous steps with right hippocampus. Slicing: The slicing stage should be prepared in advance and can be reused multiple times. It consists of a circular thin piece of cork pad of equal diameter to the plastic disc of the McIlwain tissue chopper and glued on it with parallel pieces of double-sided adhesive tape. The clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform can be adjusted to match the thickness of the slicing stage (Figure 16C). Place a piece of filter paper on the slicing stage and moisten it with chilled oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Using a fine brush (or a spatula with its flat side bent at right angles) gently lift the hippocampus from the bottom of the beaker. Figure 16. Photographs showing proper positioning of the left rat hippocampus on the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (refer to text for details) Lay the isolated hippocampus on the slicing stage with its top side up (the dorsal face containing the alveus). It is often possible to view striations on the alvear surface of this side, with oblique light from a fiber optic. Using the brush gently straighten the bottom surface of the hippocampus so that it lies completely flush on the moistened filter paper. Only the dorsal hippocampus will be sliced from each side. To immobilize the hippocampus, one may therefore affix the ventral hippocampus (the thicker end) on the cork of the slicing stage with an insect pin (Figure 16A). Slide the slicing stage with the affixed hippocampus through the clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (Figure 16C). Rotate the slicing stage on the platform so that the dorsal hippocampus is properly oriented with respect to the razor blade: the blade should make a 15° angle with the transverse axis of the dorsal hippocampus (Figures 16B, 16C). Excitatory pathways are better preserved when an angle of 15 to 30° from this axis is used (Alger et al., 1984). In general, the alvear striations will tend to run parallel to the blade at this orientation. If the hippocampus on the left hemibrain is used, it will look like an upright “U” as viewed from above with the dorsal hippocampus on the right and the (pinned) ventral hippocampus on the left (Figures 16A-16C). To achieve the proper cutting angle, rotate the slicing stage 15° counterclockwise. Similarly, if the right hippocampus is used, it will resemble an inverted “U”, and the stage is rotated 15° clockwise. Wet the blade with ACSF and make the slices by lowering the blade through the hippocampus. Each slice should stick on the wet surface of the blade as it ascends. The first 3 (most dorsal) complete slices are usually discarded. Depending on the age of the animal, 6 to 8 slices of 450 mm thickness can be obtained from rats (Figure 16B) and 4-5 such slices from mice. The speed and the strength of impact of the blade should be adjusted so that the slices are cut gently, but quickly enough to avoid sticking of the uncut hippocampus on the ascending blade. The blade should not slam on the surface of the cutting stage; ideally it should just dimple the surface of the wet filter paper on the chopping stage. Quickly remove the slices from the blade as they are produced using a moistened fine sable brush. Immediately after making each slice, transfer it to a test tube filled with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Take great care to avoid stretching or excessively bending the slices during handling. One method is to pick the slices from the blade with the brush premoistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF, using a gentle rolling motion. Some of the ACSF moisture on the brush will also stick on the blade and help the next slice stick to the blade after it has been sliced off the hippocampus. Immediately after making the slices, transfer them to the interface recording chamber to recover for at least 2 h. The slices should rest on a mesh at the gas-liquid interface, forming a small meniscus around them (Figures 17A, 17B and 17C), and should be constantly superfused from both their top and bottom side with (non-recirculating) 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 μl/min. Note: Please also consult the following video articles offering detailed information on acute hippocampal slice preparation for long-term recordings: Villers and Ris (2013); Shetty et al. (2015). Figure 17. Photographs showing proper positioning of a rat hippocampal slice in an Oslo-type interface recording chamber. A. The slice lies on a mesh, near the wall of a recording bath. The chamber has two such recording baths, both of which are covered by a removable convex canopy that creates a humidified, oxygen-rich atmosphere above the slice. The canopy has a triangular opening that allows recording from each slice individually (while the slice in the other bath remains covered). Each slice is constantly superfused with ACSF flowing into the bath through an inflow tube and out through an outflow conduit (across from the inflow), which leads to the suction well (the suction is provided by a yellow syringe needle). B and C. At interface, a small meniscus is formed around the slice. A larger meniscus is formed around the walls of the bath. Part III: Application of oligodeoxynucleotides to slices in recirculation mode In ODN experiments, after recovery from dissection in interface mode, increase the bath level to fully submerge the slices and allow the superfusate containing 20 μM of the oligodeoxynucleotide to recirculate (5 ml total volume at 5 ml/min for 30 min). To achieve this, follow these steps: Copy and load the program of Figure 18 on the top Arduino of Figure 14 (“Microcontroller 1” in Figure 2A). Change the value of “delay” to “1800000”, save the new program and reload to top Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of ADC via the winLTP program, the top Arduino will turn on all six of the micropumps for 30 min. Load the Arduino PWM library (see link) and copy and load the program of Figure 19 on the bottom Arduino of Figure 14 (“Microcontroller 2” in Figure 2). Change the “int32_t clockfrequency” value to “200”, save the new program and reload to the bottom Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of the ADC via the winLTP program, the bottom two pumps will supply a flow rate of 5 mL/min (Figure 20) to the inlets of the recording chamber (the four ouflow pumps of the suction, once on, will always operate at maximum flow rate). Turn off the peristaltic pump, and at the same time turn off the vacuum suction. Figure 18. Arduino program that activates simultaneously all six mp6 oems and keeps them active for a designated period. The program allows turning all six of the mp6 micropumps on simultaneously when prompted by one of the digital outputs of the ADC, which is in turn controlled by the “Slow0 Perfusion Change” function of the winLTP program. By changing the “delay” value (highlighted in yellow) the slices can be perfused for variable intervals. In this particular example the pumps will remain on for 1800000 ms (i.e., 30 min). Turn on the piezoelectric pump circuit using the SPST push button master switch. Use a three-way valve to manually switch between the peristaltic pump drawing solution from a main reservoir (typically a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask held inside a water bath with a clamp) and the two-micropump assembly of the bath inlet, which should be drawing solution from a 15 ml conical tube containing the recirculating solution with the ODN (inside the same water bath as the main reservoir). Start the winLTP program with Sequential Protocol Scripting and Automated Perfusion Control (Anderson et al., 2012; see also Chapter 10 of the WinLTP software manual (Anderson, 2018). Note: The automated perfusion control is currently only supported by National Instruments M- or X-Series ADC boards). Use the Slow0 Perfusion Change for controlling one perfusion line to one extracellular slice chamber. Figure 19. Arduino program that performs pulse width modulation (PWM). The program allows changing the frequency of the signal generated by the mp6-OEM from the default value, to reduce the mp6 micropump flow volume from its maximum value (5.5 ml/min). The frequency of the OEM signal is altered by changing the value of “int32_t clockfrequency” (highlighted in yellow). The current value “int32_t clockfrequency = 75” yields a flow rate of approximately 2.5 ml/min (see Figure 20). Note: Library download link: https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino-pwm-frequency-library/downloads. Note: The digital output from the National Instruments M- or X-Series board is connected to Arduino 1, and it will activate both the assembly consisting of the two independent micropumps that control the inlets to the bath, as well as the multipump array that controls the suction. Make sure the tube at the output of the aspirator leads the solution back to the 15 ml conical tube to complete the recirculation circuit. If necessary, adjust the height of the suction tube in the suction well of the chamber to raise the bath level and fully submerge the slice. After 30 min of recirculation in the submersion mode and to begin recording, lower the bath level of the ODN-containing solution by lowering the aspirator tube to interface level and return the flow rate to 0.5 ml/min for the remainder of the experiment by changing the “int32_t clockfrequency” value from 200 to 10, and loading again the program of Figure 19 to the Bottom Arduino Uno. Figure 20. Changing the flow rate of single mp6 micropump by pulse-width modulation (PWM). By inserting different values for “int32_t clockfrequency” (x-axis of the graph), the flow rate (y-axis) can be changed from the low rates of a few hundred microliters per min (shown in the insert) required for interface chamber recordings, to a maximal flow rate of 5.5 ml/min. Place stimulating and recording electrodes in the hippocampal layers of interest and begin electrophysiological recordings. For experiments to study long-term synaptic plasticity lasting many hours, record field EPSPs (fEPSPs) with a glass extracellular recording electrode (2-5 MΩ) placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum, with concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes placed on either side within CA3 or CA1. Exclude from study slices if initial analysis shows fEPSP spike threshold < 2 mV. Confirm independence between the two stimulated pathways by the absence of paired-pulse facilitation between the two pathways. Set the baseline fEPSP at 25% of the spike threshold and monitor it by delivering stimuli at 0.033 Hz to each pathway. Induce LTP by strong HFS, consisting, for example, of standard two 100 Hz-1s tetanic trains, spaced 20 s apart, which is optimized to produce a relatively rapid onset of protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP (Tsokas et al., 2005; Tsokas et al., 2016, Hsieh et al., 2017). For rat hippocampal slices deliver the tetanus at 70% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2017), and for mouse slices use 25% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2016). The maximum slope of the rise of the fEPSP can be analyzed on a PC using the WinLTP data acquisition program (Anderson and Collingridge, 2007). Notes Comparison of interface and submersion chamber: oxygenation and efficacy of aPKC inhibitor ZIP on synaptic transmission Most studies examining long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices, employ Oslo-type interface recording chambers, rather than submerged chambers, because the former are believed to provide superior oxygenation and preservation of normal synaptic function (Khurana and Li, 2013). We tested this assumption, by using a galvanic dissolved-oxygen probe (Atlas Scientific KIT-106; zinc anode, silver cathode, 15% sodium tetraborate/15% sodium chloride electrolyte; polyethylene membrane) to measure the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Oslo-type interface recording chamber and in the same chamber used in submersion mode with flow rates ranging from 2 to 15 ml/min. The dissolved oxygen probe was calibrated using distilled water and ambient air, as described by the manufacturer. The accuracy of the instrument was further tested by measuring dissolved atmospheric oxygen in ACSF (14,000 μS/cm) at room temperature (23.5 °C). The average value (8.1 ± 0.01 mg/L; n = 5) was in agreement with previously reported data for atmospheric dissolved oxygen equilibrium at different temperatures and salinity conditions (Radtke et al., 1998). Air from a medical air cylinder, or 100% oxygen (both from TW Smith) was then bubbled through the gas dispersion ring (or the ceramic aerators) of the water jacket of the Oslo-type chamber at 31.5 °C, and the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured inside the recording chamber, under interface conditions, with the probe clamped on a micromanipulator and held a few millimeters above the surface of the mesh (where the meniscus surrounding the slice is normally formed). A standard curve of oxygen saturation vs. concentration was thus generated for the tip of the probe moistened with ACSF (6.9 ± 0.3 mg/L at 21% O2; 31.1 ± 0.8 mg/L at 100% O2; n = 5; linear fit through 0, r2 = 0.99). With 95% O2-5% CO2 bubbling through the water jacket, the oxygen concentration immediately above the slice at the interface was 29.6 ± 0.7 mg/L (95.1 ± 2.3% saturation; n = 5). The Oslo-type chamber was then converted into a submersion chamber: the suction was raised to increase the level of the superfusate inside the recording bath, the oxygenation via the aerators in the water jacket was turned off, and the flow rate was increased to obtain oxygen concentration/saturation measurements at 2, 5, 10 and 15 ml/min. Under submersion conditions, and immediately above the position where the slice would be in an actual experiment, the following oxygen concentration (mg/L) and % saturation measurements were obtained (n’s = 4)—2 ml/min: 19.6 ± 0.9 (62.5 ± 2.8%); 5 ml/min: 22.7 ± 1.4 (72.4 ± 4.6%); 10 ml/min: 25.5 ± 1.7 (81.6 ± 5.7%); and 15 ml/min: 26.9 ± 1.9 (86.3 ± 6.2%). These measurements are in agreement with values reported for different types of submersion chambers described elsewhere, using carbon-fiber microelectrodes, DO optical sensors, polarographic cells (i.e., amperometric Clark electrodes), or a colorimetric chemical (indigo carmine) methods (Hájos et al., 2009; Dondzillo et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2018). These results demonstrate that the oxygen saturation in the superfusate of submersion chambers (see, for example, Volk et al., 2013) is substantially lower than in the humidified atmosphere that envelops slices in Oslo-type interface chambers, especially at the flow rates commonly used (72.4 ± 4.6% for a submersion chamber with flow rate 5 ml/min, compared to 95.1 ± 2.3% for an Oslo-type interface chamber). The effects of lower oxygen saturation on slice health might be further exacerbated when the slices are recovered under submerged conditions after preparation (as in Volk et al., 2013). We next asked whether the differences of oxygenation obtained in interface vs. submerged chambers have physiological effects on synaptic physiology. We specifically addressed whether chamber design might explain a difference that has been reported in the effects of the atypical PKC inhibitor ZIP on basal synaptic transmission. Whereas consistently ZIP reverses late-LTP in all published studies in which it has been studied (see, for example Ling et al., 2002; Sajikumar et al., 2005; Pastalkova et al., 2006), in most of these studies the effect of the PKMζ inhibitor is specific to potentiated synaptic pathways with no effect on basal, untetanized synaptic pathways. This specificity of the inhibitor to potentiated and not basal synaptic transmission is identical to results obtained with applications of the agent to LTP and basal synaptic transmission recorded in vivo (Pastalkova et al., 2006; Madroñal et al., 2010). However, one study reported that ZIP had effects on both late-LTP and baseline synaptic transmission (Volk et al., 2013). This study, however, was unusual in that the late-LTP recordings and basal synaptic transmission were recorded in hippocampal slices held in a submerged chamber. We therefore directly compared the effects of ZIP on LTP and baseline synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices recorded in an interface and in a submersion chamber. To keep all other parameters as constant as possible, the interface chamber slices recovered in the same chamber in which their recordings take place; whereas the submersion chamber slices were placed in an interface chamber, which was then immediately converted into a submersion chamber by increasing the flow rate and bath level of the ACSF solution, and the slices were then allowed to recover for another 90 min (the total recovery time of both sets of slices in the two experiments is kept equal). As seen in Figure 21, in slices recovered and recorded in an interface chamber, ZIP specifically reverses late-LTP maintenance in the tetanized pathway without affecting basal neurotransmission in the untetanized pathway. In contrast, in slices recorded under submerged conditions, ZIP reverses LTP maintenance, eventually below baseline, and also has an effect on an independent untetanized pathway. This effect of ZIP on the untetanized/basal pathway was similar to that seen in Volk et al. (2013). A plausible explanation for this difference is that there is a pool of atypical PKC involved in neuroprotection from hypoxia (see Tian et al., 2008) that is separate from the pool of PKMζ that maintains late-LTP. Because the oxygenation conditions in an interface chamber are superior to those for submerged slices, the effect of ZIP on basal neurotransmission in a submersion chamber may reflect the effects of the inhibitor on the neuroprotective role of atypical PKC that is induced by the relatively hypoxic conditions of the slice (Tian et al., 2008). Alternatively, the low-oxygen conditions of submerged chambers may have induced hypoxic LTP in the untetanized synapses, rendering them sensitive to ZIP. Importantly, as mentioned above, the specificity of ZIP to potentiated and not basal synaptic transmission is seen in vivo in the hippocampal perforant path dentate gyrus input (Pastalkova et al., 2006), hippocampal CA3-CA1 (Madroñal et al., 2010), and layer 4 primary visual cortex (Cooke and Bear, 2010). Thus, high-oxygen interface chambers, but not low-oxygen submerged chambers appear to produce conditions of synaptic transmission and plasticity that more closely reflect in vivo conditions. In addition to inferior oxygenation conditions, another factor that may have contributed to the artifactual response to ZIP of the untetanized pathway in Volk et al. (2013) is the intensity of the conditioning stimulus used to induce late-LTP. The intensity of the Volk et al. (2013) protocol, which was delivered at 75% of the maximum EPSP response, is appropriate for rat Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 synaptic stimulation, but is much higher than what is normally used to induce LTP in mouse hippocampal slices, which is typically between 25% of the spike threshold, as in Tsokas et al. (2016), and 50% of maximum EPSP in Abel et al. (1997), Nguyen et al. (2000), Barco et al. (2002), Opazo et al. (2003), Selcher et al. (2003), Kelleher et al. (2004), Costa-Mattioli et al. (2005), Antion et al. (2008), Pavlowsky and Alarcon (2012), Gruart et al. (2012), Li et al. (2017), Puzzo et al. (2017), Amorim et al. (2018). Such strong repetitive synaptic stimulation in Volk et al. (2013) may have further undermined neuronal health, thereby contributing to the artifactual drop below the baseline of the EPSP in the untetanized pathway in response to ZIP. Figure 21. Brain slice late-LTP experiments in an interface vs. submersion chamber. A. ZIP (5 μM) applied during the maintenance phase of late-LTP reverses potentiation without effect on the untetanized pathway (from Tsokas et al., 2016; n = 5). B. In contrast, in slices (n = 3) that have recovered in an interface chamber (for equal time as the slices in A), which was then converted into a submersion chamber by increasing the bath level and flow rate of the ACSF, 5 μM ZIP not only reverses LTP in the tetanized pathway but also decreases basal synaptic transmission in the untetanized pathway. This difference may be due to the superior oxygenation conditions in interface chambers (oxygen saturation is 95.1 ± 2.3% in an Oslo-type interface chamber, compared to 72.4 ± 4.6% in a submersion chamber with a typical flow rate of 5 ml/min). Protection from excitotoxicity In order to protect from excitotoxicity during the slice-making process we recommend using ice-cold high magnesium/low calcium ACSF solutions and performing the slice preparation procedure inside a 4 °C cold room. Lowering the temperature decreases the metabolic rate of cells thus reducing their energy consumption, allowing the cells to survive ischemia during slice preparation. In addition, we recommend using a special, non-physiological ACSF during dissection (Dissection ACSF) that contains 10 mM magnesium and 0.5 mM calcium. Both these departures from physiological CSF are known to reduce excitotoxicity (Feig and Lipton, 1990; Sacktor et al., 1993; Wang and Kass, 1997; Ting et al., 2018). mp6 micropump noise There are two sources of noise in the system: (a) noise from the electrical signal of the OEM, and (b) noise generated in the solution because of the vibration of the ionic ACSF by the pump actuators. These sources of noise can be completely silenced by (a) making a metal enclosure for the circuit and mini-Faraday cages for the pump “sandwich” arrays, and (b) grounding the recirculating ACSF both at the inflow to the bath and at the suction, using T-shape tubing connectors with a silver chloride wire connected to the main ground of the rig. Passive check valves mp-cv To eliminate potential back flow of the ACSF owing to differential pressure between the pump inlet and the outlet (due to differences, for example, between the height of the recording chamber and the height of the ACSF reservoir, or the connecting tubes), use a passive check valve encased in stainless steel manufactured by Bartels Mikrotechnik (mp-cv). The valve, which will influence the volume flow of the micropump, should be placed between the micropump and the outflow reservoir. Figure 15C shows four such mp-cv check valves connected to the array of four mp6 micropumps controlling the suction of the interface recording chamber. Metal enclosure for the piezoelectric pump system For safety reasons (to protect against electric shock from the OEMs), as well as to eliminate the noise produced by the OEMs and to protect the circuit from damage, the completed circuit of Figure 14 should be placed inside a metal enclosure that is grounded. The enclosure should have an opening for the ribbon cable of the Breakout Board connecting the micropump assemblies, as well as openings for the power supply cables, the two USB cables of the Arduinos, the master switch of the circuit, and the BNC cable connecting the top Arduino to the ADC board. Hybrid persistaltic/piezoelectric pump arrangement A simplified alternative to the recirculation device described here is to use piezoelectric pumps only for the aspirating the recirculation ACSF, and a peristaltic pump to provide the inflow to the chamber. In this arrangement, a peristaltic pump with a two-channel pump head would control the inflow (alternatively, a four-channel pump head can be used, if the interface chamber supports two independent baths for slices). One piezoelectric array (or two, depending on the number of baths supported by the interface chamber) would control the aspirator, with each array consisting of four mp6 micropumps driven by the suction part of the circuit (i.e., the top four OEMs) at the maximum flow rate. Pre-flushing the dead volume of the perfusion system before switching solutions When 95% O2-5% CO2-aerated ACSF stays in polyethylene or Tygon tubing for a long time before being perfused onto slices, it degases and becomes hypoxic. The loss of carbon dioxide also alters the pH of the standard bicarbonate buffer of the ACSF. It is therefore important to “pre-flush” the dead volume in the perfusion system before switching solutions. In the experiments described in Tsokas et al. (2016), two manual three-way valves in series allowed pre-flushing the dead volume in the tubing of the inflow mp6 micropump assemblies by switching the upstream three-way valve from the idle peristaltic pump (OFF) to the idle mp6 micropump (ON), and switching the downstream three-way valve so that the outflow from the micropump flows directly into waste (ON), rather than into the slice chamber (OFF). In this configuration, turning the micropump on for 10 seconds before switching it back off allows the dead volume to clear. Following this procedure, first turn the downstream valve’s outlet to the waste to OFF, before turning the mp6 micropump back on to resume operation of the perfusion system. WinLTP 2.30 has four perfusion line controls (Slow0, Slow1, Fast0, and Fast1) that can be used for controlling piezo steppers and pinch valves for automatic changing of bath perfusion. For an excellent discussion of how to use these features with commercially available pinch valve systems for automated pre-flush perfusion of slices, see Chapter 10 of the WinLTP 2.30 manual (Anderson, 2018). The mp6 micropumps are sensitive and will be severely damaged if liquid is forced into them by applying pressure with a syringe. If the micropumps fail to draw liquid when initially turned on (usually due to incomplete purging of their contents during previous use), it is best to connect the inlet of the mp6 to proper tubing attached to the tip of a vertically positioned 20 ml syringe barrel (i.e., without the plunger, and with its tip pointed towards the ground). Turn the micropump on, pour a few mL of water into the barrel of the syringe, and allow gravity to assist the micropump’s vibrating piezoelectric diaphragms in clearing the chambers of the pump.

Recording synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices maintained in a small-volume recycling-, perfusion-, and submersion-type chamber system. J Vis Exp (131).. Ex vivo acute brain slices have been a useful experimental model for studies of neural function at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels. Advances in knockout techniques have also greatly facilitated the generation of genetically modified mice. Hippocampal slices from these mutant mice have become one of the most widely used experimental paradigms for studying both normal synaptic plasticity and its dysfunction in animal models of human psychiatric and neurological disorders.Several studies, however, have revealed that genetic compensation in response to gene knockout is a widespread phenomenon (for review, see El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017). Upregulation of related genes following gene knockout can either attenuate or completely compensate for the function of the deleted gene, leading to experimental findings that can be misinterpreted.Such compensation can be avoided by acutely blocking the de novo synthesis of the target gene product with a brief application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). ODNs are short single-stranded synthetic DNA molecules, often modified with phosphorothioate linkages to enhance stability. ODNs can bind to complementary regions of a specific mRNA, usually located near the translation start site (AUG, in Figure 1A, top), and physically block the ability of ribosomes to move along the mRNA, preventing synthesis of the protein. Because the effects of ODNs are rapid, the possibility of altered regulation of other genes that can occur with more prolonged gene deletion is reduced. Potential off-target effects may occur, but can be minimized with the appropriate design of the ODN and by pharmacogenetic experiments employing ODNs together with knockouts that lack the target mRNA (Tsokas et al., 2016). Most previous studies employing ODNs to suppress gene expression in brain slices, however, first infuse the ODN into the brain by intracranial or intraventricular injection, and then soon after the injection prepare the tissue slice (Matthies et al., 1995; Guzowski et al., 2000; Garcia-Osta et al., 2006). Although effective in introducing the ODN into the brain, the injection itself often damages the neural tissue, resulting in suboptimal recordings from brain slices prepared adjacent to the injection site. In addition, the injection delivers the compound as a bolus at a high concentration that then must diffuse through the brain tissue in the intact animal prior to the slice preparation. As a result, the experimenter does not have precise control over the concentration of the compound present in the slice at the time of recording. If a high drug concentration in the bolus injection is required, this in turn can lead to questions about pharmacological specificity.The method described in this protocol renders the perfusion of brain slices with antisense-ODN as easy as the application of any other soluble reagent or drug. Therefore, the technique may be preferable to the standard method of intracranial or intraventricular injections followed by preparing brain slices. In addition, electrophysiological recordings are in an “Oslo-type” interface brain slice recording chamber. Interface chambers are preferable to submersion chambers for long-term recordings of brain slices because they provide superior oxygenation (for detailed discussion, see Note 1). This protocol was first used in Tsokas et al. (2016) to block specifically the new synthesis of protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) in response to strong afferent tetanic stimulation (high-frequency stimulation, HFS) without inducing genetic compensation by the other atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCι/λ, as occurs in PKMζ-null mice. Indeed, in these mutant mice, long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation appear largely intact because the normal physiological function of PKMζ is largely compensated by PKCι/λ (Tsokas et al., 2016).Genetic compensation for LTP and spatial long-term memory in PKMζ-null mice was revealed in Tsokas et al. (2016) by a pharmacogenetic analysis of wild-type and PKMζ-null mice using PKMζ-antisense ODN. In these experiments, the normal physiological function of PKMζ was selectively blocked by taking advantage of the specific nucleotide sequence of the PKMζ-mRNA translation start site to design a PKMζ-antisense ODN (Figure 1A) that suppresses the activity-dependent de novo synthesis of PKMζ. Twenty μM PKMζ-antisense was bath-applied to acute wild-type mouse slices and recirculated for 1 h before tetanization and during the critical period of new protein synthesis after tetanization when PKMζ is formed (Osten et al., 1996), i.e., during the temporal window when general protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin are effective in blocking late-LTP induction (Frey and Morris, 1997). The PKMζ-ODN suppressed the new synthesis of PKMζ (Figure 1B) and late-LTP (Figure 1C) without affecting the upregulation of PKCι/λ or the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), proteins that are also rapidly synthesized in LTP (Tsokas et al., 2016; Figure 1B). Because the turnover of PKMζ is relatively slow (Osten et al., 1996), basal amounts of PKMζ in untetanized slices were unaffected (Tsokas et al., 2016). The application of PKMζ-antisense did not suppress LTP in PKMζ-null mice, in which the target of the PKMζ-antisense is absent (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate that in the mutant mice another molecule compensates for the loss of PKMζ. Conversely, a selective PKCι/λ inhibitor reversed established LTP only in the PKMζ-null mice and not in wild-type mice (Tsokas et al., 2016, Figure 3). This double dissociation between the mechanisms of LTP in PKMζ-null and wild-type mice revealed that when PKMζ is absent there is functional compensation by PKCι/λ.Figure 1. Acute perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with PKMζ-antisense ODN (20 μM) via the mp6 micropump system reveals that PKMζ is necessary for late-LTP in wild-type mice, and compensation accounts for late-LTP in PKMζ-null mice. A. Top: Schematic of the PKMζ-antisense. Bottom: Bath pre-application and recirculation of 20 μM biotinylated PKMζ-antisense in ACSF for 1 h in Tg(Thy1-EGFP)MJrs/J mouse hippocampal slices allows highly efficient penetration of the ODN in pyramidal EGFP-filled neurons (green), as verified with cy3-conjugated streptavidin staining of biotinylated ODN (red) post-fixation. B. Bath-applied PKMζ-antisense blocks new synthesis of PKMζ, but not PKCι/λ or the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) that are also synthesized in LTP. C. Bath-applied PKMζ-antisense blocks late-LTP in wild-type mice but has no effect on LTP in PKMζ-null mice. [A top, B, C: Adapted from Tsokas et al. (2016). For images of Western blots demonstrating the specificity of the PKMζ and PKCι/λ antisera please refer to Figure 2 Supplement 1 and Figure 3 Supplement 2, respectively, from that publication].The blockade of late-LTP and the suppression of activity-dependent PKMζ synthesis with bath-applied, recirculating PKMζ-antisense was also replicated in acute rat hippocampal slices (See Figures 2A, 2B, and S4B from Hsieh et al., 2017). Taken together, these findings suggest that the crucial pool of PKMζ protein that sustains synaptic potentiation is provided by de novo synthesis in response to tetanization, rather than through the recruitment of pre-existing, basal PKMζ that had been synthesized before the tetanus. Thus, the use of antisense ODN to specifically suppress new synthesis of PKMζ without affecting basal levels of the kinase is advantageous over genetic knockdown/knockout not only because it prevents genetic compensation, but because it distinguishes between basal PKMζ and the pool of PKMζ that is synthesized in response to HFS. The results reveal that only the newly synthesized pool can support late-LTP. A similar argument can be made for the use of acute translational blockade by antisense ODN rather than genetic knockdown/knockout in behavioral experiments designed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the formation and persistence of long-term memory under physiological conditions in wild-type animals (Tsokas et al., 2016; Hsieh et al., 2017).Since first described (Tsokas et al., 2016; Hsieh et al., 2017), PKMζ-antisense has been applied acutely on hippocampal slices in two other studies (Dasgupta et al., 2017; Sharma and Sajikumar, 2018) via a peristaltic pump (non-recirculating ACSF). These reports also showed a blockade of LTP.In our protocol, antisense ODN is delivered by a custom-built recirculation system that perfuses brain slices resting in an “Oslo-type” interface recording chamber with a small (5 ml) recirculating volume of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The system employs the mp6 micropump, a piezoelectric diaphragm pump developed by Bartels Mikrotechnik GmbH (Dortmund, Germany) for the transport of liquids or gases at varying flow rates and/or pressures controlled by an external electronics circuit. For liquids, each mp6 micropump supplies a maximal flow rate of 5.5 ml/min. With parallel connection of multiple mp6 units the volume flows summate. The mp6 can be controlled by the commercially available mp-x controller, or alternatively by the mp6-OEM, both of which are manufactured by Bartels. The mp6-OEM is a small (10.5 x 20.5 x 6 mm) driving circuit capable of generating up to 270 V peak-to-peak voltage at 100 Hz frequency from a 5 V power supply (therefore proper safety measures are required). The OEM controller drives the micropump at adjustable performance and can be integrated into system electronics, a PCB design, or as in the case of this protocol a breadboard.Each mp6-OEM is intended for operating one mp6 micropump. Therefore, the six mp-x controllers that would be required for driving the mp6 arrays used in this protocol would make the cost of using the commercially available controller quite steep–as opposed to using six mp6-OEMs and building a custom-made circuit at a small fraction of the price. The mp6-OEM has a built-in interface that allows the user to adapt the adjustable parameters (frequency and amplitude) of the rectangular signal generated by the OEM by the use of external components, such as a circuit consisting of a potential divider and a capacitor, or a microcontroller capable of pulse-width modulation (PWM). For the purposes of this protocol, an Arduino Uno is used with a simple program that performs PWM to control the amplitude and/or the frequency. Using an open source Arduino library and a program provided with this protocol, the user may achieve flow rates between 0.2 ml/min and 5.5 ml/min from each mp6 micropump, appropriate for maintaining brain slices (see Figure 20).The schematic in Figure 2A represents a simplified version of the circuit that controls the flow rate of the pumps which supply ACSF to the recording chamber (inflow micropumps, controlled by the OEM circuit at the bottom via Microcontroller 2). Figure 2A also shows a simplified version of the circuit controlling the suction pumps (outflow micropumps, controlled by the OEM at the top). To achieve laminar flow when the chamber is operated in submersion mode, i.e., during ODN delivery prior to stimulation and recording, slices are perfused on two sides–at the top and the bottom of the mesh. Two micropumps driven by two separate OEMs are therefore used for controlling the inflow: one pump perfuses the top of the mesh, and the other supplies ACSF to the part of the chamber below the mesh (Figures 15A and 15B). A “sandwich” consisting of four mp6 pumps connected in parallel fashion is used to supply the suction that completes the ACSF recirculation circuit (Figure 15C). These four mp6 micropumps operate constantly at maximal flow rate and are therefore controlled by a simpler version of the circuit used for the two inflow micropumps, which does not perform pulse-width modulation.A separate Arduino Uno microcontroller (Microcontroller 1) is used to turn all the mp6 micropumps on/off in a concerted fashion according to inputs received by the ADC and the software driving the electrophysiology experiment. In this manner, the recirculation system can be used in combination with a peristaltic pump via a three-way valve and activated only during drug application.The first part of this protocol is a description of how to build the electronic circuit that controls the operation and flow rate of the mp6 micropump arrays. The second part provides a detailed hippocampal slice preparation protocol for electrophysiology in interface chambers. The protocol includes modifications of the classic method described in the scientific literature, which, based on our experience, we believe are necessary for making high-quality slices suitable for long electrophysiological recordings and subsequent biochemical and immunocytochemical analysis.In addition, we provide evidence for the advantage of interface over submersion electrophysiology chambers for long recordings of acute brain slices required for the study of long-term synaptic plasticity (see Note 1). Whereas low-oxygen submersion chambers show unstable baseline synaptic transmission following long-term applications of the zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), the interface electrophysiology chambers maintain stable baseline synaptic transmission, as observed after applications of ZIP in vivo (Pastalkova et al., 2006). Thus, because brain slices maintained in interface chambers more closely preserve the in vivo physiological state, they are the preferred method for investigating the long-term synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory.Figure 2.

        "@value": "In vitro Tumorsphere Formation Assays. A tumorsphere is a solid, spherical formation developed from the proliferation of one cancer stem/progenitor cell. These tumorspheres (Figure 1a) are easily distinguishable from single or aggregated cells (Figure 1b) as the cells appear to become fused together and individual cells cannot be identified. Cells are grown in serum-free, non-adherent conditions in order to enrich the cancer stem/progenitor cell population as only cancer stem/progenitor cells can survive and proliferate in this environment. This assay can be used to estimate the percentage of cancer stem/progenitor cells present in a population of tumor cells. The size, which can vary from less than 50 micrometers to 250 micrometers, and number of tumorspheres formed can be used to characterize the cancer stem/progenitor cell population within a population of in vitro cultured cancer cells and within in vivo tumors (Lo et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2009). While several cell lines can be used for tumorsphere formation assay (e.g. primary mammary tumor cells from Her2/neu-transgenic mice, MCF7, BT474 and HCC1954), some cell lines may not form typical tumorsphere structures and may be difficult to count or classify definitively as tumorspheres.. Add B27 supplement (50x) to tumorsphere medium for making 1x concentration as needed for experiments. B27 should be freshly added before each experiment. Note: The addition of B27 has been shown to increase tumorsphere formation and sustain several passages of sphere cultures (Gu et al., 2011). Harvest cells and suspend the resulting pellet in 5 ml 1x PBS. Keep cells on ice while not in use for the duration of the experiment. Gently mix the suspension and pipette 20 μl of the suspension into an eppendorf tube. Add 20 μl (1:1 ratio) of Trypan Blue to the cells in the eppendorf tube and mix well. Pipette approximately 10 μl of the mixture onto the hemocytometer. Count only the bright cells within the four corner quadrants of the counting chamber for viable cell count. Take the needed number of cells and add the appropriate volume of tumorsphere medium to make the cell concentration at 1 cell/L. Keep this suspension on ice and mixed well for plating. Add 1x PBS to the first and last columns (column 1 and 12) of the 96-well plate to help minimize medium evaporation. This will leave 10 wells available for each row. Seed 200 μl of the cells suspended in tumorsphere medium into each well (200 cells per well). Note: The number of cells used for tumorsphere formation assays may vary with the cell type. For each cell line or treatment, seed cells into the wells of 2 rows for a total of 20 wells. This will equal a total of 4,000 cells. Seal the upper and lower edges of the 96-well plate with laboratory tape to avoid evaporation of medium and place the cells in an incubator set to 37 °C and supply the cells with 5% CO2 for one week. Note:The medium is not changed or added so as to not disturb the formation of the tumorspheres. After one-week incubation, tumorsphere numbers are counted under a phase-contrast microscope using the 40x magnification lens (See Figure 1). Results can be presented as a percentage of the number of tumorspheres present divided by the initial number of cells seeded (4,000 cells).."

The standard crystal violet-based plaque assay relies on virus’ ability to induce cytopathic effect (CPE) which limits the assay to lytic viruses. Alternative viral quantification assays such as 50% tissue culture infectious assay (TCID50) and genetic material quantification by Q-PCR provide a different way of viral quantification with their own shortcoming. In here, we modified the fluorescent focus assay and developed an antibody-based immunoplaque assay which provides a reliable and reproducible viral quantification independent of CPE. Our assay not only allows accurate determination of viral titer, but also provides information on viral kinetics, genetic stability and purity of the virus population.. Each well on a 12-well plate is seeded with 5 x 105 MDCK cells suspended in 1 ml of cDMEM. The plate is incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.."

        "@value": "A Protocol to Map the Spatial Proteome Using HyperLOPIT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The correct subcellular localization of proteins is vital for cellular function and the study of this process at the systems level will therefore enrich our understanding of the roles of proteins within the cell. Multiple methods are available for the study of protein subcellular localization, including fluorescence microscopy, organelle cataloging, proximity labeling methods, and whole-cell protein correlation profiling methods. We provide here a protocol for the systems-level study of the subcellular localization of the yeast proteome, using a version of hyperplexed Localization of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging (hyperLOPIT) that has been optimized for use with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The entire protocol encompasses cell culture, cell lysis by nitrogen cavitation, subcellular fractionation, monitoring of the fractionation using Western blotting, labeling of samples with TMT isobaric tags and mass spectrometric analysis. Also included is a brief explanation of downstream processing of the mass spectrometry data to produce a map of the spatial proteome. If required, the nitrogen cavitation lysis and Western blotting portions of the protocol may be performed independently of the mass spectrometry analysis. The protocol in its entirety, however, enables the unbiased, systems-level and high-resolution analysis of the localizations of thousands of proteins in parallel within a single experiment.. Cell culture At least 3 days before you plan to carry out the experiment, streak-plate an appropriate yeast strain from a cryostock onto a YPD agar plate. Incubate at 30 °C in a stationary incubator for approximately 2 days until colonies form and subsequently store at 4 °C for several weeks. The following day, transfer the starter culture to a flask filled with fresh medium. For a typical hyperLOPIT experiment we recommend culturing 720 OD units of yeast, which equates to 1.2 L of culture at OD600 of 0.6. For this volume of culture, we use 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks. Dilute such that the cells undergo a minimum of 2 doublings prior to harvest so that the desired cell density is reached at a convenient time. Note: The amount of cells required for a new growth condition, which yields enough protein per collected density gradient fraction for downstream steps of the hyperLOPIT protocol (> 50 μg per fraction), should be empirically determined for each experiment in question. For experiments where the goal is not to perform hyperLOPIT, smaller cultures should be sufficient, but this should be determined by the investigator. When the required OD600 has been reached, harvest cells by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. For this step, use 500 ml bottle assemblies and the JLA 10.500 rotor in the Avanti centrifuge. Cell pre-treatment for lysis Resuspend the cell pellet, still in the 500 ml bottle assemblies, in TCEP reduction buffer at 5 OD units per ml and incubate for 5 min at room temperature without shaking. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min in the Avanti centrifuge to harvest the cells and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in spheroplasting medium at 20 OD units per ml and transfer to 50 ml Falcon tubes. Add 1 μl of zymolyase 100-T solution per OD unit of yeast used in the experiment. Note: Spheroplasting medium is composed of the same constituents as the medium that was used for cell culture, to maintain the same conditions as were used for culture. We do not, however, recommend the use of conditioned media for this step. The media should be made fresh and include 1.0-1.2 M sorbitol and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to maintain osmotic support and the appropriate pH during spheroplasting. Withdraw a 10 μl aliquot of the solution and dilute in 990 μl of water. Measure the OD600 after blanking the spectrophotometer with an equivalent dilution of spheroplasting medium in water. Note: Spheroplast conversion efficiency is conveniently monitored by spectrophotometry. Absorbance of the cell suspension at 600 nm is proportional to the number of intact cells that are present in the suspension. Spheroplasts are very fragile and sensitive to changes in the tonicity of a solution. As such, transferring them to an osmotically unsupported solution will result in lysis of the spheroplasts. Only the remaining intact cells contribute to the absorbance at 600 nm, indicating the amount of cells that have undergone conversion to spheroplasts. Incubate at 30 °C for 10 min with shaking at 200 rpm and measure OD600 of a 1:100 dilution. The OD600 should be around 10% of the pre-digestion OD600, indicating around 90% zymolyase digestion efficiency. Note: This step should not be allowed to continue for more than 10 min, as incubation in the presence of zymolyase for too long can result in uncontrolled cell lysis. Harvest cells, without transferring to new tubes, by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,500 x g, 4 °C and resuspend in spheroplast wash medium. Note: The pellet can be sticky and difficult to resuspend, but do not vortex or pipette vigorously as this risks lysis of the fragile spheroplasts. Resuspend with a trimmed 1 ml pipette tip, use a glass rod or gently invert to resuspend. Due to the risk of lysis, do not aim for a homogeneous suspension of cells at this point. Harvest the cells for 5 min at 1,500 x g, 4 °C and discard supernatant. Optional: Nuclear preparation Note: If greater nuclear resolution is not of particular interest, skip to Section D. Optionally perform a nuclear preparation according to Kizer et al. (2006) with modifications described subsequently. For this protocol, we use approximately 120 OD units of spheroplasts for a nuclear preparation and 600 OD units for the main subcellular fractionation. Note: This step is optional and if other organelles are of special interest, enrichments for these organelles may be performed instead of a nuclear preparation, as was performed in two previous hyperLOPIT studies (Christoforou et al., 2016; Thul et al., 2017). Resuspend the spheroplasts in Ficoll lysis buffer and transfer to a Dounce homogenizer. Lyse with 20 up-down strokes on ice. Note: As in the original paper (Kizer et al., 2006), we use the “tight” Dounce pestle for the entirety of lysis, and do not advocate “pre-resuspension” with the “loose” pestle. Pre-clear the lysate for 10 min at 3,220 x g, 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to a 32 ml round-bottomed ultracentrifuge tube. Balance the opposite position of a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) with a tube of the same mass and density and centrifuge at 50,000 x g, 4 °C for 35 min. Use “MAX” acceleration and deceleration. Discard the supernatant and resuspend pellet in buffer NP with vigorous pipetting. Store resuspended nuclear-enriched pellet at -80 °C. Lysis for density gradient centrifugation Resuspend the remaining 600 OD units of spheroplasts in 1x LB at 20 OD units per ml and transfer to the chamber of the nitrogen cavitation vessel. Lyse using a method modified from Wang et al. (2014). Charge the vessel with oxygen-free nitrogen to 500 psi and incubate for 3 min. Note: The nitrogen within the cylinder is under pressure and if the inlet tap is opened too quickly, it can lead to the target pressure of 500 psi being overshot. Therefore, open the inlet tap slowly and closely monitor the pressure gauge to obviate the chance of this occurring. Release the pressure by opening the gas inlet valve, so that the pressure drops to 300 psi. Allow a further 3 min of incubation and discharge the vessel by opening the outlet port at the base of the vessel. Collect the lysate at approximately 3 drops per second. Note: As the nitrogen is released from solution during lysis, the pressure within the nitrogen cavitation vessel will drop and consequently the lysate will be released more slowly. Therefore monitor the rate at which the lysate is released from the outlet port and, if necessary, open the port more to maintain a steady rate of approximately 3 drops per second. Clear the lysate of debris, aggregates, and unlysed cells and spheroplasts by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C. Subject the supernatant to another round of centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 x g, 4 °C. Crude membrane preparation Prepare 18% (w/v) OptiPrep solution with the aid of a handheld refractometer and calibration curve of known OptiPrep concentrations and their refractive index measurements, measured in degrees Brix (°Bx) (see Note 1). Transfer the cleared lysate into four round-bottomed ultracentrifuge tubes (~7.5 ml lysate per tube). Underlay the contents of each tube with 5 ml 18% (w/v) OptiPrep cushion solution, prepared in 1x LB, using a syringe attached to a blunt-ended, wide-bore needle. Notes: Even though it is possible to fit the entirety of the lysate in a single round-bottomed centrifuge tube, we do not recommend this. If this is done, upon ultracentrifugation, the sheer amount of protein in the entirety of lysate will cause it to aggregate on top of the cushion solution. This may cause damage to organelle membranes and affect the results of the experiment as a whole. We find that if the lysate is split as described, this does not occur. When underlaying with 18% (w/v) OptiPrep cushion solution, take the utmost care to not to introduce any air bubbles into the cushion solution. If these are introduced it will result in mixing of the lysate with the OptiPrep solution, disrupting the crisp interface that should be present between the two solutions. Ultracentrifugation of a solution where this has occurred will prevent formation of a crude membrane interphase that would normally form between the two solutions, defeating the object of performing this step. Instead this will potentially cause the membranes to pellet and aggregate at the bottom of the tube. To prevent this happening, use the graduations on the syringe as a guide to the amount of OptiPrep solution withdrawn before underlaying. Before commencing the underlaying of the lysate, press down gently on the syringe plunger to allow a single drop of OptiPrep to be released from the wide-bore needle (to expel any air that may be present). Submerge the needle at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube and begin injection of the cushion solution, keeping a close eye on the level of the liquid within the syringe. As soon as the meniscus of the liquid drops to the level of the connection between the syringe and needle, stop injecting. Remove the needle and discard the remainder of the solution. Balance the four tubes to within 10 mg of each other and place the tubes in opposing sides of an SW32Ti swinging-bucket rotor. Centrifuge the tubes for 2 h at 28,000 rpm (96,300 x g), 4 °C. Select an acceleration profile of “MAX” and a deceleration profile of “9” (the slowest deceleration that uses a brake). This minimizes disruption of the membrane interphase that forms upon ultracentrifugation. Withdraw the cytosol-enriched supernatant from the tube, leaving between 1 and 2 cm of the supernatant above the membrane interphase, so as not to disturb the crude membrane interphase. Store the supernatant at -20 °C for further processing. Withdraw the membrane-containing interphase using a trimmed 1 ml pipette tip into a separate tube, taking care not to withdraw too much solution from either above or below the interphase. Isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation and fraction collection Adjust the concentration of OptiPrep in the collected membrane interphase solution to 16% (w/v), monitoring the concentration using a handheld refractometer (see Note 1). Notes: Using 600 OD units of culture typically yields around 2-3 ml of crude membranes at this step. The aim should be to adjust the refractive index of the crude membranes to the required value in as small a volume as possible and to make up the remainder of the 11.2 ml volume of the resolving gradient tube with pre-prepared 16% (w/v) OptiPrep. If this is not adhered to, it may result in the undesirable situation that the membranes, in the correct OptiPrep concentration, are split across multiple density gradients. We find that preparing a self-generating gradient using 16% (w/v) OptiPrep provides good separation of the major subcellular organelles in yeast (Figure 2). This step may be modified if a different gradient shape is desired or specific subcellular organelles are the main focus of the experiment. Figure 2. Representative data obtained using the protocol described here. After performing hyperLOPIT in S. cerevisiae with the optional nuclear preparation, two-dimensional Principal Components Analysis reveals the resolution of 12 separate organelles and protein complexes within the S. cerevisiae spatial proteome map, across three principal components. These encompass the main subcellular organelles of the organism (data reproduced from a single replicate performed in our previous study [Nightingale et al., 2019]). Within each plot each point represents a single protein group, points that are colored represent proteins determined by hyperLOPIT to localize to a specific organelle and light grey points represent protein that do not have a localization predicted by hyperLOPIT. Prepare a balance tube containing 16% (w/v) OptiPrep and use to fill a blank vertical rotor tube, which does not contain any membranes and acts as a balance tube. Balance the tubes to within 10 mg of each other, using 16% (w/v) OptiPrep solution. Place the two tubes in opposing sides of a VTi65.1 rotor and float aluminum spacers on top of the tubes. Screw the rotor lids on and centrifuge at 65,000 rpm (362,900 x g), for 4 h at 4 °C. Select an acceleration profile of “MAX” and a deceleration profile of “9” (the slowest deceleration that uses a brake). This acts to minimize disruption to the density gradient that has formed on ultracentrifugation. Remove the tubes from the VTi65.1 rotor. Remove and discard the plastic plugs. Prepare a Labconco Auto-Densiflow peristaltic pump with meniscus tracking probe for fraction collection by connecting a piece of collection tubing approximately 40 cm long to the probe. Clamp on to the peristaltic pump. Note: If an Auto-Densiflow fraction collector is unavailable, fractions may be collected by puncturing the bottom of the tube and allowing the gradient fractions to drip out from the bottom and most dense, fraction to the top and least dense fraction. Alternative fractionators are available, from Brandel and Teledyne Isco, but these have not been tested for use with hyperLOPIT. We do NOT recommend collecting fractions by pipetting from the top of the gradient as this requires a high level of technical skill and is very susceptible to error, which will result in mixing of different parts of the gradient and ruin the entire experiment. Flush the tubing with distilled water into a waste container and follow this by flushing through with air. Flush through with 1x LB and then air. Insert the gradient tube into the tube holder and set the probe direction to “down” until the probe finds the gradient meniscus, at which point the probe will stop moving. Set the probe to “deposit” and collect 23 fractions from the gradient into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, of which 22 should be 0.5 ml and one should be ~0.2 ml. Note: This step is not automated, so volumes collected per fraction should be monitored closely by eye until the required volume has been collected for the fraction in question. Store fractions at -80 °C until further processing. Monitoring gradient shape Thaw gradient fractions and vortex well to ensure that the iodixanol content in the OptiPrep-containing fractions is uniformly suspended within the fraction. Determine refractive index of each fraction using a handheld, analog refractometer. Use approximately 20 μl of each fraction for this step. Note: If the refractive index of any fraction exceeds the maximum refractive index of the refractometer, dilute that fraction with water and re-measure. Do not use 1x LB. Multiply the resultant refractive index by the dilution factor to obtain the undiluted refractive index measurement. Monitor density gradient shape by plotting fraction number against the refractive index of that fraction. The result should be a slightly sigmoidal curve that is relatively flat in the middle of the gradient and becomes steeper in the last 2-3 fractions (Figure 3). If monitoring organelle distribution by enzyme assay, take an aliquot here with which to do this, and perform enzyme assays. Note: We have not attempted such methods in S. cerevisiae but methods are available in the literature if this is desired. Figure 3. Typical gradient shape achieved using the concentration of OptiPrep and the density gradient ultracentrifugation parameters detailed within this protocol. Fractions were collected using an Auto-Densiflow fraction collector and are numbered in ascending order from the least to the most dense fraction of the gradient. Fraction processing Process all fractions (including separate organelle preparations and cytosol-enriched fraction) further by TCA precipitation, followed with acetone washing. For this add ¼ of the volume of 100% (w/v) TCA, prepared in water and vortex well. Incubate for 2 h at 4 °C to allow the protein content of each of the fractions to precipitate from solution. Harvest precipitates by centrifugation at maximum speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. Discard supernatants. Wash pellets in acetone that has been pre-chilled to -20 °C. Vortex extensively and subject to sonication cycles (30 s on and 30 s off) in a Diagenode BioRuptor Plus sonicator, until the pellets break down completely and become powdery. Notes: If the pellets do not break down completely, they may be difficult to resolubilize in downstream steps of this protocol. If a BioRuptor is not available, other sonicators may be used for this step. Repeat centrifugation, acetone washing, and sonication twice more; each time discarding the supernatant. Discard supernatants and allow pellets to dry briefly at room temperature until acetone evaporates (see Note 2). Sample resolubilization and protein concentration estimation Resolubilize each pellet in protein resolubilization buffer with extensive sonication. Note: Resolubilize in the minimum volume in which the entire protein content is soluble. For this step, begin with 50 μl of protein resolubilization buffer per pellet and monitor for the presence of any pellet in the fraction by centrifugation, as in the TCA precipitation step (Section H, step 3). Add further aliquots of protein resolubilization buffer, sonicate, and spin down to monitor the presence of any protein pellet. As soon as no pellet is visible after centrifugation, this indicates that the protein content has been resolubilized to completion. Estimate protein concentration in each fraction using a protein concentration estimation assay, preferably in 96-well plate format. Notes: If the recommended protein assay kits are not available, other protein estimation assays may be used, as long as they are compatible with 100 mM HEPES and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. We recommend the use of 96-well plate format assay as sample amounts in hyperLOPIT experiments can be extremely limited and this conserves the maximum amount of each sample for Western blotting and isobaric tag labeling. Determine overall protein yield. The ideal yield per fraction for isobaric tag labeling should be > 50 μg, allowing for an extra 1 μg per fraction used for downstream Western blotting. If fractionation is required without isobaric tag labeling, lower yields will be suitable. Monitoring organelle resolution by Western blot Monitor organelle resolution using Western blotting against a panel of antibodies raised against marker proteins whose resolution is characteristic of the organelle which they represent (see Note 3) (Table 1). Table 1. Suggested antibodies for use with hyperLOPIT in S. cerevisiae. The suggested primary and secondary antibody dilutions are based on Western blots that are carried out using 1 μg of total protein per lane of an SDS-PAGE gel. Normalize the amounts of each fraction (including the nuclear preparation, cytosol-enriched fraction, and density gradient fractions) to 1 μg of total protein and heat to 95 °C in the presence of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Load each fraction on a single well of a pre-cast, gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Subject the samples to electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE minigels in TGS buffer and using the full length of the gels. Use a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system and power pack for this step and run the gel at 200 V. Transfer to Trans-Blot Turbo polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, using the mixed molecular weight program on a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo apparatus. Cut membranes into appropriate molecular weight ranges (see Note 3) and incubate each strip in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature on a rotary mixer. Probe each strip with the appropriate primary antibody, diluted in blocking solution (see Note 4). Incubate overnight at 4 °C, with shaking on a rotary mixer (see Table 1 for suggested dilutions). The following day, place the membranes back at room temperature and wash three times for 5 min each in TTBS. Probe with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution (see Table 1 for suggested dilutions), for 1 h at room temperature. Discard secondary antibody and wash 3 times for ten minutes each in TTBS. Proceed to detection of signal using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate. Expose each membrane with X-ray film until the desired level of signal has been reached (see Figure 4 for an example Western blot). Assuming a suitable yield (see Note 5) has been obtained, proceed to the next section if it is desired to proceed with the hyperLOPIT protocol. Figure 4. Representative Western blot typical of an experiment on S. cerevisiae, performed using the hyperLOPIT protocol described here, in the absence of a nuclear preparation and probing using the antibodies described in Table 1. The fractions are numbered in the order in which they were collected using the Labconco fraction collector, from the first and least dense fraction, to the twenty-third and most dense fraction. The separate cytosol-enriched fraction is denoted by “C”. Modified from (Nightingale et al., 2019). Protein reduction, alkylation and digestion For experiments including nuclear preparations, select the nuclear preparation, cytosol-enriched fraction, and use the remainder of the isobaric tags to label fractions from the density gradient. In experiments that do not include nuclear preparations, select the cytosolic fraction and use the remainder of the tags to label gradient fractions (see Note 4). This recommendation is the same whether TMT 10- or 11-plex tags are being used, or isobaric tags of lower multiplexing capability. Note: Fractions should be chosen for labeling on the basis of relative enrichment of organelles of interest, and relative depletion of other contaminating organelles, as determined by Western blotting. It should be noted that, even though proteins from only 7 organelles are probed in this Western blotting scheme, we are able to resolve 12 subcellular locations within our final dataset (Figure 2). Indeed, a well-designed fractionation scheme will result in the resolution of subcellular locations within the final spatial proteome map that were not included within the Western blotting experiment, as they will resolve discretely within the density gradient. Normalize each fraction to the same amount of protein (50-100 μg) and make up to the same volume (100 μl) with protein resolubilization buffer. Note: The amount of total protein may be reduced if yields are not high enough to use 100 μg of each fraction. We do not, however, recommend labeling < 50 μg of each of the selected fractions. Add 11.1 μl of dithiothreitol (DTT) solution prepared in protein resolubilization buffer to each sample. Incubate for 1 h at 56 °C to allow reduction of disulfide bonds. Return to room temperature and add 12.3 μl of iodoacetamide (IAA) solution to each sample. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Add 1 ml of acetone to each fraction, vortex the fractions briefly and allow protein content to precipitate in acetone overnight at -20 °C. The following day, centrifuge all precipitated fractions at maximum speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge for ten minutes at 4 °C. Discard the supernatants and briefly air-dry the pellets (see Note 2). Resuspend the pellets in 87.5 μl of digestion buffer by vortexing. Digest with trypsin at 1:20 (w/w) protease:protein ratio, at 37 °C for 16 h. Add trypsin in two aliquots (1:40 (w/w) protease:protein ratio) spaced 1 h apart, such that the final volume of the digest is 100 μl. TMT labeling (modified from the TMT 10-plex kit user guide) This section describes labeling of digests with TMT tags. If using a different isobaric labeling chemistry, consult the relevant labeling protocol that comes with the kit. The following day, clear the digests of any insoluble material by centrifugation for 15 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Allow a TMT kit to equilibrate to room temperature. Before opening the vials, briefly pulse-centrifuge them. Add 41 μl of acetonitrile to each tag vial. Vortex well and allow to solubilize for 5 min. Transfer each resolubilized tag to a different digest and incubate for 2 h at room temperature on a shaking platform. Add 8 μl of 5% (v/v) hydroxylamine, prepared in digestion buffer to each sample and incubate for 30 min on a shaking platform at room temperature. Add 100 μl of HPLC-grade water to each sample and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. Pool all labeled digests into a single tube and dry to completion in a vacuum centrifuge at 10 °C. Store at -80 °C until sample clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Sample clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) (modified from a previous publication [Villen and Gygi, 2008]) Equilibrate a Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge with 1.8 ml of 100% (v/v) HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN). Flush through with 600 μl Equilibration Buffer. Flush through with 1.8 ml of Desalting Buffer 1. Resolubilize sample in 1 ml 0.4% TFA and ensure that pH < 2. To achieve this, check pH using pH paper on a small aliquot (~10 μl) of sample. If pH > 2, keep adding aliquots of 10% TFA, checking pH after each addition until pH < 2. Note: The buffering capacity of residual HEPES from the digestion and isobaric tag labeling steps can keep pH high, even in the presence of 0.4% TFA. Ensure that pH < 2 before loading on the SPE cartridge, or the labeled peptides will not bind to the tC18 material and will, instead, be lost. Load resolubilized peptides onto the cartridge and allow to bind to the packing material. Desalt in 1.8 ml Desalting Buffer 1. Flush with 180 μl Desalting Buffer 2. Elute the desalted peptides from the cartridge using 1 ml Elution Buffer and remove a small aliquot corresponding to approximately 5-10 μg of labeled peptides. Dry the samples to completion in a vacuum centrifuge at 10 °C. Pre-fractionation by high pH reversed phase (RP) chromatography Fractionate the sample using high pH reversed phase chromatography prior to mass spectrometric analysis, on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. Resolubilize solid phase extracted sample in 100 μl RP resolubilization buffer by vortex mixing and spin down in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed. Transfer supernatant to an Acquity autosampler vial and place in the autosampler of a Waters Acquity UPLC system, maintained at 10 °C. Note: If desired another chromatography system may be used, that is capable of running in normal flow. Inject the sample onto the system and run using the gradient parameters shown in Table 2. Monitor sample elution using a photodiode array (PDA) detector, scanning wavelengths from 210-400 nm. Collect fractions at 1-min intervals with the aid of a timed fraction collector and freeze to completion on dry ice. Table 2. Parameters for use during high pH reversed phase pre-fractionation of hyperLOPIT samples on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. The entire LC gradient is 75 min long. Within the gradient, 0-10 min, 62-67.5 and 67.6-75 min should be isocratic. The gradient between each of the switching steps that is documented within this Table should be linear (represented by “6” with the Waters UPLC Inlet Method software). Dry fractions to completion in a vacuum centrifuge at 10 °C. Store dried fractions at -80 °C. Use the collected chromatographic data to determine the collected fractions that correspond to the peptide-containing chromatographic space. LC-SPS-MS3 analysis of samples Resuspend the dried samples in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and pool equal amounts in the following scheme: Pool the first with the middle fraction, the second with the second-from-middle, and so on until the end of the peptide-containing elution space. Note: Pooling the samples in this fashion not only makes better use of the second dimension of peptide fractionation (low pH RP coupled in-line to the mass spectrometer) (Zhang et al., 2011), but also reduces mass spectrometry analysis time by half. Load approximately 1 μg of each pooled fraction into the autosampler of the Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano chromatography system. Note: Base this measurement either on the protein estimation that was performed prior to Western blotting and protein digestion or, perform a peptide estimation assay to determine the amount to load. Analyze each pooled fraction by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using 120-min gradient on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled in line to the Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoUPLC system. Acquire data using an LC-SPS-MS3 method (McAlister et al., 2014). For details about the methods used for LC and MS, see previous publications that have employed TMT 10-plex quantitation coupled with SPS-MS3 to perform hyperLOPIT studies (Christoforou et al., 2016; Thul et al., 2017; Mulvey et al., 2017). Alternatively, in the absence of a Fusion series mass spectrometer, use an appropriate LC-MS/MS method on the mass spectrometer that is being used for analysis. Notes: We recommend using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Fusion series mass spectrometer, as the SPS-MS3 capability (McAlister et al., 2014) offers greater quantitative accuracy and precision in the measurement of the abundance of each TMT 10- or 11-plex reporter ion in a specific scan, relative to the sole use of MS/MS. SPS-MS3 involves synchronous selection of multiple MS2 fragment ions, arising from the target precursor ion, for further fragmentation in an MS3 scan. This liberates TMT reporter ions that arise solely from the target precursor ion, in the absence of reporter ion signal arising from the fragmentation of contaminating ions that were co-selected in the MS1 scan. Other tandem mass spectrometers may be used for these experiments, but they will be more susceptible to issues (Ting et al., 2011; Wenger et al., 2011) with co-selection of contaminating precursor ions in addition to the ion targeted for fragmentation by MS/MS. This will result in a reduction in the overall quantitative accuracy and precision of quantitation in the experiment, a direct readout of which will be diminished organelle resolution in the final hyperLOPIT spatial map. Analysis of TMT labeled samples using mass spectrometers that are not of high enough resolution may preclude the use of 10- or 11-plex TMT tags due to an inability to resolve the isotopolog N and C tags, which will result in reporter ion coalescence (McAlister et al., 2012) and, consequently, in inaccurate quantitation. In such cases, isobaric tags with lower multiplexing capability should be used. Analyze the extra, non-fractionated, sample collected at the SPE step using the same mass spectrometry method as was used in Step O3 above. This will enable characterization of the isobaric tag labeling efficiency. Note: It is recommended that the isobaric labeling efficiency be characterized for every hyperLOPIT experiment, independently of the analysis of the pre-fractionated samples by LC-SPS-MS3 or other LC-MS/MS method. The test ensures that the efficiency of labeling of both peptide N-termini and ε-amino groups of lysine residues with isobaric tag reagents is high enough (i.e., essentially complete). Indeed, we observe that labeling efficiencies are typically > 99% using this method. It should be noted that if either the pH or acetonitrile concentration is modified during isobaric tag labeling, it will result in diminished stability of the isobaric tag labeling reagents, hydrolysis of the reagents, or undesirable side-reactions with residues such as tyrosine, serine, and threonine. This will result in incomplete labeling of peptides, which will lead to inaccurate PSM-level and overall protein-level quantitation. This will result in non-representative and reduced overall organelle resolution in the final hyperLOPIT spatial map.. Knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein is crucial in defining its functions within the cell and regulation of the spatial organization of the proteome is essential for cellular homeostasis. Subcellular protein localization allows proteins to act as members of higher-order complexes with binding partners such as proteins, metabolites and co-factors, and contribute to the functions of organelles. In some cases, the sequestration of enzymes within specific subcellular compartments is critical to ensure that intermediates are not exchanged between different metabolic pathways or that potentially detrimental reactions (e.g., proteolysis) are confined to a ‘safe’ space. Protein localization can be influenced by post-translational modification, such as the phosphorylation of proteins within signaling cascades that ultimately allow proteins such as transcription factors (TFs) to localize within the nucleus to exercise their gene regulatory functions, or allowing other proteins to traverse the nuclear membrane and regulate nuclear-localized transcription factors. One example is the case of the osmostress response pathway in yeast, where a signaling cascade is activated that results in the phosphorylation of the protein Hog1p, whereupon it can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate the TF Hot1p which, in turn, can recruit RNA polymerase II to the promoters of responsive genes (Alepuz et al., 2003).A growing body of evidence suggests that differential protein localization, even within the same cell type, may allow the protein to fulfil different roles depending on its respective localization within a cell, sometimes referred to as “moonlighting” (Gancedo et al., 2016). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, examples of such proteins include Gcn4p, which is the general transcription factor that controls amino acid biosynthesis (Hope and Struhl, 1986) and also acts as a ribonuclease (Nikolaev et al., 2010); as well as Aco1p, which has roles in mitochondrial DNA stability in addition to its more widely known function as tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme (Chen et al., 2005). Isoforms of the same protein have further been observed with different localizations in the same cell type, suggesting that this differential localization may offer another level of regulation with regard to protein function. An example of this is the case of a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1) in murine stem cells, in which one isoform localized to chromatin and the other isoform is found in an alternative nuclear location (Christoforou et al., 2016).It is clear that there are many levels of complexity regarding protein subcellular localization. In order to fully understand the in vivo functions of proteins, it is vital to ascertain where, within the cell, they are located. Several methods exist that can be applied to approach this challenge, including fluorescence microscopy imaging, organelle proteomics, proximity biotinylation methods, and protein correlation profiling methods; all of which have been applied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in different contexts to determine the subcellular localization of yeast proteins. Whole-cell, high-throughput studies based on fluorescence microscopy have been performed using GFP- or other fluorescence protein-tagged protein libraries (Huh et al., 2003; Tkach et al., 2012; Breker et al., 2013; Denervaud et al., 2013; Chong et al., 2015; Weill et al., 2018; Yofe et al., 2016). Although powerful, these methods have documented problems in that the fluorescence signal of a particular protein of interest may not exceed the background level of cellular autofluorescence, particularly in yeast, and therefore it may not be possible to determine the location of such proteins. Additionally, some proteins may require their unmodified C- or N-terminus for correct localization (Weill et al., 2018; Yofe et al., 2016). As such, performing protein localization studies where proteins are tagged with a fluorescent protein either N- or C-terminally to the ORF in question may result in a given protein being reported with different localizations within the same biological system, depending on which strategy was used (Stadler et al., 2013).Organelle enrichment strategies have also been employed to define organelle proteomes, thereby contributing to our knowledge on protein localization. These strategies often exploit the characteristic buoyant densities of organelles in their enrichment. The relative ease with which mitochondria can be highly enriched, for example, has been exploited in many studies that have attempted to define the mitochondrial proteome, with varying levels of specificity, in S. cerevisiae. This includes some studies that used more crude approaches to attempt to define the mitochondrial proteome (Sickmann et al., 2003; Reinders et al., 2006) or specific sub-mitochondrial proteomes (Zahedi et al., 2006; Vogtle et al., 2012) in some cases without control for other organelle proteins that were co-enriched along with the mitochondrial proteins. Improvements have been made in recent studies that mapped the entirety of the mitochondrial sub-organellar proteome using more complex fractionation and proteome quantitation methods (Morgenstern et al., 2017; Vogtle et al., 2017). For organelles of more heterogeneous density, however, the difficulty of such studies can be compounded by the presence of contaminating membranes from other organelles that co-enrich with the organelle of interest (Wiederhold et al., 2010). In focusing on a specific organelle, such methods fail to report on proteins that may be present at multiple locations in vivo. Further, there is no control for the proportion of an organelle that is lost upon enrichment.Recently, new proximity labeling methods based on promiscuous biotinylation have shown promise in determining protein subcellular localization in organisms other than yeast. This includes the more detailed study of sub-organellar proteomes (Rhee et al., 2013; Hung et al., 2014), including cytoplasmic faces of organelles (Hung et al., 2017). The BirA-based BioID method (Roux et al., 2012) has been applied in S. cerevisiae to define the subcellular proteins that interact with a ribosomal scaffold protein (Opitz et al., 2017) and the APEX2 method (Lam et al., 2015) has been demonstrated to traverse the cell wall in proof-of-principle experiments in both S. cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Hwang and Espenshade, 2016). Methods such as these focus only on the proximal interactors of a protein of interest, that are currently in the range of tens of nanometres (Rhee et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014) and do not provide a whole-cell picture of the spatial organization of the proteome. To overcome some of the inherent limitations of the methods described above, it is imperative to look at protein subcellular localization in the context of the whole cell. This has been commonly studied using whole-cell protein correlation profiling methods. Such methods are predicated on the observation that, when cell lysates are fractionated by some means, such as differential or density gradient centrifugation, proteins that localize to the same organelle will exhibit similar distributions when the protein distributions across the entire fractionation scheme are monitored (de Duve, 1971). This was originally monitored using enzyme assays that are representative of the organelles in question, but now employs quantitative mass spectrometry methods. Several such methods have been published, which offer differing levels of proteome coverage and subcellular resolution, employing different fractionation and mass spectrometry quantitation methods (Christoforou et al., 2016; Itzhak et al., 2016; Jean Beltran et al., 2016; Mulvey et al., 2017; Jadot et al., 2017; Geladaki et al., 2019). The hyperplexed Localization of Organelle Proteins by Isotope Tagging (hyperLOPIT) method uses density gradient centrifugation for subcellular fractionation, followed by multiplexed proteome quantitation using 10-plex TMT isobaric tags (Thompson et al., 2003) and SPS-MS3 quantitation on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. The exquisite subcellular resolution offered by the density gradient coupled with multiplexed quantitation, followed by sophisticated machine learning analysis methods means that hyperLOPIT allows unbiased protein localization determination of thousands of proteins in parallel in a single experiment. Indeed the method has afforded the highest resolution spatial map of any whole-cell correlation profile-based spatial proteome study to date (Thul et al., 2017; Gatto et al., 2019).We recently published a yeast spatial proteome mapping study in which we mapped the proteome in high throughput using hyperLOPIT, under nitrogen-sufficient conditions (Nightingale et al., 2019). In our study, we produced a dataset that provided localization data for 2,846 proteins. Only 936 of these proteins were found to map to a unique subcellular location, a number which corresponded to 32% of our observable spatial proteome. This suggests, in common with previous studies (Christoforou et al., 2016; Thul et al., 2017), that a large proportion of the proteome is dynamic or resides at multiple locations. We provide here a protocol that describes how to perform nitrogen cavitation lysis (Hunter and Commerford, 1961; Simpson, 2010; Wang et al., 2014) subcellular fractionation, and a version of the hyperLOPIT protocol that has been modified for use with the yeast S. cerevisiae (see Figure 1 for an overview of the protocol). We further draw the reader’s attention to the fact that the subcellular fractionation and Western blotting portion of this protocol may be performed as a standalone experiment without TMT labeling. Further to this, in cases where a mass spectrometer capable of resolution of TMT 10- or 11-plex tags (such as the Thermo Fusion series) is not available, isobaric tags with lower multiplexing capability may instead be used. This may be achieved using iTRAQ (Ross et al., 2004) 4- or 8-plex, or TMT 6-plex, but, importantly, will result in reduced overall subcellular resolution relative to TMT 10- or 11-plex, as less of the subcellular fractionation gradient will be sampled in the experiment. HyperLOPIT and its predecessor, LOPIT, have been employed to great effect to map the subcellular proteomes of multiple different species and under numerous conditions (Sadowski et al., 2006; Nikolovski et al., 2012; Groen et al., 2014; Christoforou et al., 2016; Thul et al., 2017). We envisage that this protocol will therefore be applicable and modifiable to study the spatial proteomes of other yeasts, including the industrial yeast Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) and pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans.We recently published a protocol in Methods in Molecular Biology (Nightingale et al., 2018) that describes how to perform hyperLOPIT in S. cerevisiae. The lysis and subcellular fractionation portions of this protocol are substantially updated from a previous protocol by Wang and colleagues (2014). Here we provide a protocol with updated mass spectrometry data processing parameters using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, www.thermofisher.com), and with more focus on post-mass spectrometry informatics analysis. For a more in-depth and detailed informatics protocol than is presented here, we direct the reader to the publication of Breckels and colleagues (Breckels et al., 2016b). The subcellular fractionation portion of the hyperLOPIT protocol is technically challenging, requiring an unbroken stretch of experimental work lasting from cell harvest to gradient fraction collection. We strongly recommend that experimental work not be paused until the gradient fractions have been collected.Figure 1. Overview of the hyperLOPIT method for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Also included in parentheses are approximate timescales for each step, and potential stopping points."

        "@value": "Use of Gas Chromatography to Quantify Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Serum, Colonic Luminal Content and Feces of Mice. Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) are a product of the fermentation of resistant starches and dietary fibers by the gut microbiota. The most important SCFA are acetate (C2), propionate (C3) and butyrate (C4). These metabolites are formed and absorbed in the colon and then transported through the hepatic vein to the liver. SCFAs are more concentrated in the intestinal lumen than in the serum. Butyrate is largely consumed in the gut epithelium, propionate in the liver and acetate in the periphery. SCFAs act on many cells including components of the immune system and epithelial cells by two main mechanisms: activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and inhibition of histone deacetylase. Considering the association between changes in SCFA concentrations and the development of diseases, methods to quantify these acids in different biological samples are important. In this study, we describe a protocol using gas chromatography to quantify SCFAs in the serum, feces and colonic luminal content. Separation of compounds was performed using a DB-23 column (60 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter [i.d.]) coated with a 0.15 µm thick layer of 80.2% 1-methylnaphatalene. This method has a good linear range (15-10,000 µg/ml). The precision (relative standard deviation [RSD]) is less than 15.0% and the accuracy (error relative [ER]) is within ± 15.0%. The extraction efficiency was higher than 97.0%. Therefore, this is cost effective and reproducible method for SCFA measurement in feces and serum.. Sample preparation Collect blood from cardiac puncture or axillary plexus. Maintain blood at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and centrifuge (3,000 x g, 8 min). Collect the serum and freeze at -80 °C in 1.5 ml microtubes. Collect fecal pellets directly from each mouse in microtubes. For this, raise the animal holding the tail, position the microtube in the proximity of the anus and collect the pellets that are excreted. Two or three pellets from each animal are adequate. After euthanasia, collect the colons and gently remove the luminal contents of the proximal part. To do this, use the forceps to collect directly into microtubes and freeze at -80 °C. Keep all biological samples frozen at -80 °C until the day of analysis. For feces and colonic luminal content, transfer 20 mg of these into 1.5 ml microtubes and add 200 µl of distilled water. Homogenize using a metal spatula. In 1.5 ml microtubes, add the sample (200 µl serum or homogenate of feces with water, see Step A5), a 200 µl mixture of organic solvents composed of N-butanol, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile in a 50:30:20 ratio, 40 µl HCl 0.1 M, 20 mg citric acid and 40 mg sodium chloride. Shake the microtubes vigorously using the vortex stirrer for 1 min. Centrifuge the samples at 14,870 x g at room temperature for 10 min. Using an automatic pipette, transfer the supernatant to chromatographic vials equipped with 200 µl inserts and analyze by GC-FID (Figure 1). Figure 1. Sample preparation. A. Liquid-liquid extraction procedure of samples. Serum samples (200 µl) were extracted with the same volume of a mixture of solvents. B. Liquid-liquid extraction procedure for feces and colonic luminal content samples. Fecal samples (20 mg) were previously homogenized with distilled water and subjected to the extraction procedures described in Steps A5-A8 of Sample preparation section. GC procedure Adjust the temperature of the injector to 250 °C. Inject contents (5 µl) in a split ratio of 25:1, using the DB 23 capillary column Agilent, 60 m x 0.25 mm of internal diameter (i.d.), and coated with a film of 0.15 µm composed of 80.2% 1-methylnaphthalene. The mobile phase is composed of N2 at an initial flow rate of 1 ml/min and maintaining this for 1 min, then changing to 0.8 ml/min for 1 min, changing to 0.6 ml/min for 1 min and then reverting to 1 ml/min for 9.2 min. Adjust and maintain the temperature of the FID detector at 260 °C. Adjust the flow of the H2 and the synthetic air to 30 ml/min and 350 ml/min, respectively. Adjust the temperature program of the oven to100 °C, maintain for 7 min and increase to 200 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min and maintain for 5 min.. The microbiota is a complex, heterogeneous and dynamic group of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi) that colonizes the tissues in direct contact with the external environment including the skin and the genitourinary, intestinal and respiratory tracts. Several studies have demonstrated recently that these microorganisms are important for maintaining host homeostasis. Indeed, changes in their composition can lead to dysbiosis, as observed in specific pathological conditions, and have been associated with their development, as shown for inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic inflammatory conditions (Ferreira et al., 2014; Nishida et al., 2018; Sokolowska et al., 2018). Short chain fatty acids are bacterial metabolites produced by components of the microbiota. The most abundant and studied molecules of this class are acetic, propionic and butyric acids, which are normally found in their deprotonated forms (e.g., acetate, propionate and butyrate). SCFAs modify important processes including metabolism, immune system development and activation, and intestinal barrier function strategies (den Besten et al., 2013; Correa-Fiz et al., 2016; Koh et al., 2016) have been used for changing SCFAs bioavailability in the gut including administration of probiotics (Andrade-Oliveira et al., 2015; Mendes et al., 2017), antibiotics (Fellows et al., 2018), diets with different fiber contents (Vieira et al., 2017), SCFAs in the drinking water or the butyric acid pro-drug (tributyrin) (Vinolo et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2017). Taken together, these strategies allow us to investigate the role of these metabolites in vivo in different disease models. In this context, it is essential to have a robust method for measuring the levels of these molecules in biological samples such as feces, luminal content or serum. Gas chromatography (GC) is most commonly used for SCFA analysis due to compatibility with the chemical properties of SCFAs, such as volatility, and the suitability of the detectors that can be coupled to this equipment, such as flame ionization detector (FID). FID is the most widely used for analysis of SCFAs. Due to the large amount of compounds present in the matrix, the sample should be pretreated using extraction and derivatization procedures. Recently, several techniques of derivatization have been described to obtain more stable compounds and provide greater compatibility between the stationary phase and the analytes (Karlsson et al., 2010; Walton et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). On the other hand, the use of derivation techniques has critical disadvantages, including the points that it is time-consuming, there can be losses of SCFAs, it is costly due to the use of large quantities of reagents, and the risk of occupational exposure to allergenic and toxic reagents. Some authors have described filtration and ultracentrifugation techniques to avoid the disadvantages of derivatization and obtain a fast sample preparation (Cuervo et al., 2013; Salazar et al., 2015). In spite of this, the run time is usually increased due to low purification of the samples, which increases the quantities and variety of compounds needed for separation in the column. We have chosen the ultracentrifugation technique in this protocol. Here, we describe a method that we have used to measure SCFAs in biological samples using gas chromatography equipped with FID and a liquid-liquid extraction technique. The column used in this method is composed of a high polarity stationary phase, which makes analysis of the SCFAs possible. The liquid-liquid extraction offers some advantages such as greater sample recuperation, higher sample purification, time optimization and greater separation and peak resolution in chromatograms."

        "@value": "Preparation of Outer Membrane Vesicle from Escherichia coli. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical bilayered phospholipids of 20-200 nm in size produced from all Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria investigated to date. Previous biochemical and proteomic studies have revealed that the Gram-negative bacteria-derived OMVs are composed of various components like outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane lipids, periplasmic proteins, DNA, and RNA. Here, in this protocol, we describe the method to isolate the OMVs from the culture supernatant of Escherichia coli (E. coli).. A single colony of E. coli is transferred to 5 ml of LB broth. The bacteria are incubated in an orbital bacteria shaking incubator at 200 rpm at 37 °C overnight (8 h). LB broth of 500 ml is inoculated with 1/100 volume of the overnight cultured cells. Notes: Use 2 L flask when culturing 500 ml. Also, since 1/100 volume of 5 ml is 50 μl, before inoculation, increase the volume by adding about 900 μl of fresh LB medium to reduce cell loss. The yield of OMVs in terms of protein amount is 100 μg per 1 liter of E. coli culture. The cells are grown for 12 h at 200 rpm at 37 °C. The cells are pelleted at 5,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant fraction is collected and pelleted again at 5,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant is collected and filtered through a bottle top filter of pore size 0.45 μm using a vacuum pump. The filtered supernatant is concentrated to 50-fold by ultra-filtration with a Quixstand Benchtop System using a 100 kDa hollow-fiber membrane. Note: Because the yield of OMVs is very low, in order to obtain a visible pellet after ultracentrifugation, the total volume of bacteria culture should be more than 5-7 liters. However, depending on the amount of OMV needed, the volume of bacteria culture could be reduced as well as the degree of concentration. Ex. 7 L of bacteria culture supernatant is concentrated to give about 280 ml of the concentrated supernatant to be filled in the total of four ultra-centrifuge tube (70 ml each). The concentrated supernatant is filtered once again through a 0.22 μm vacuum filter to remove any remaining debris or bacteria. The resulting filtrate is subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 150,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °C. The supernatant is removed and the pellet (purified OMV) is resuspended in PBS and stored at – 80 °C until use. Figure 1. TEM image of E. coli OMV."

        "@value": "Genome-wide Estimation of Evolutionary Distance and Phylogenetic Analysis of Homologous Genes. Homologous genes, including paralogs and orthologs, are genes that share sequence homologies within or between different species. Homologous genes originate from a common origin through speciation, genetic duplication or horizontal gene transfer. Estimation of the sequence divergence of homologous genes help us to understand divergence time, which makes it possible to understand the evolutionary patterns of speciation, gene duplication and gene transfer events. This protocol will provide a detailed bioinformatics pipeline on how to identify the homologous genes, compare their sequence divergence and phylogenetic relationships, focusing on homologous genes that show syntenic relationships using soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) as example species.. Identification of Syntenic Genes among Closely Related Species Retrieve gene sequence For given plant genomes of which the genome annotation is available, download the coding sequences (CDS) and protein sequences of all the protein-encoding genes from corresponding databases. Some species have their respective websites, such as Arabidopsis TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/), soybean SoyBase (https://soybase.org/), and maize MaizeGDB (https://www.maizegdb.org/), etc. The sequences of many of other species were deposited at NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), CoGe (https://genomevolution.org/coge/), Phytozome (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html) or other relevant databases. We downloaded all the genome sequences and gene annotation of soybean (v1.1, Schmutz et al., 2010) and common bean (Schmutz et al., 2014) from Phytozome. Removal of transposon-related and hypothetical proteins In order to detect highly confident syntelogs among closely related species, transposon-related and hypothetical proteins were first removed using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). Taking soybean (v1.1) as an example, in total 53,927 annotated genes from the 20 soybean chromosomes were BLASTN queried against the soybean transposon database SoyTEdb (Du et al., 2010, https://www.soybase.org/soytedb/). Any genes over the 80% of the total length matching the transposon-related sequences with the sequence similarities of greater than 80% were removed. Genes annotated as hypothetical proteins were excluded as well (Figure 1). Here is a typical setting for doing local blast. formatdb -i SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt -p F -o T blastall -p blastn -i Soybean_gene_cds.fa -d SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt -m 8 -a 8 -o Soybean_gene_cds_blast_TEs Note: Hypothetical proteins were identified based on the gene annotation file. The genes annotated as hypothetical proteins were not included in the analysis. Here formatdb is to format the nucleotide source database “SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt” before it can be searched using blastall. blastall is used to compare the gene sequences in the file “Soybean_gene_cds.fa” with the database “SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt”. A detailed description of each parameter can be found in the software manual. Figure 1. Bioinformatics pipeline for identification and comparison of the syntenic homologous genes in soybean and common bean. The solid and the dotted circles indicate the presence and absence of the genes in the corresponding genomes, respectively. GmA and GmB represent either of the duplicated genes in soybean. Gm, Glycine max, soybean; Pv, Phaseolus vulgaris, common bean. This figure was modified from Zhao et al., 2017. Detection of candidate syntelogs The remaining protein-encoding genes in soybean and common bean were used to do an all-against-all BLASTP search using default parameters, with the E-value cutoff 10-10 (Altschul et al., 1997). For each pair of genes, BLAST hits were loaded to the software MCScanX (Wang et al., 2012) to scan the syntelog homologous gene pairs. blastall -p blastp -i Soybean_gene_pep.fa -d Commonbean_gene_pep.fa -m 8 -a 8 -F F -o Soybean _blast_Commonbean MCScanX Soybean_CommonBean Note: The setting of E-value is based on the rough divergence time. You can leave it as default setting if the divergence time is unknown. Please prepare the required gff file for all gene locations to MCScanX. Syntenic gene pairs between soybean and common bean were identified with MCScanX’s default settings (Match Score = 50, Match Size = 5, Gap Penalty = -1, Overlap Window = 5, Max Gaps = 25 and an E-value cutoff 10-10). Post process the candidate syntelogous genes Since soybean has undergone a whole genome duplication after its split with common bean, the genes in the common bean genomes were corresponding to one or two copies in the soybean genome, depending on the duplication status of the genes retained in soybean. MCScanX provided all the homologous gene pairs in addition to syntelogous gene pairs. In order to remove the false positive syntelogous genes, the duplicated block information from the reference genome was incorporated (Schmutz et al., 2014) to keep the homologous gene pairs detected in the duplicated regions and showing syntenic relationship between soybean and common bean. Example of the final list of candidate syntelogous genes was shown in Table 1. Genes involved in tandem duplication have an ambiguous retention status and thus were put aside for separate analysis. Table 1. Example of syntenic homologous genes identified in the common bean and soybean genomes Estimation of Evolutionary Distance for Syntelogous Genes Sequence alignment Although many genes have several alternative transcripts, only the primary transcripts of the genes based on the gene annotation were used to estimate the sequence divergence between different syntenic genes of soybean and common bean. The nucleotide sequences of the syntenic genes were aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004) or ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) using default parameters. The alignment can be viewed by Jalview (Figure 2A). muscle -in input -out output or clustalw input Note: The primary transcripts of the genes were determined based on the gene annotation file which shows the primary transcripts of the genes. MUSCLE or ClustalW can only run one group of syntelogs at a time. For whole genome level analysis, we recommend that the authors write a Perl or Python script to automatically load each pair of sequences to MUSCLE or ClustalW to do the alignment. At this step, we used MUSCLE to run the alignment first, and then performed ClustalW for the remained gene pairs of which the nucleotide alignments were not integer multiples of three after MUSCLE alignment. Manual inspection The output alignment was manually inspected to modify incorrectly aligned nucleotides. This step is very important although it may not be practical if there is a very large amount of data to verify (Figure 2B). Figure 2. An example of sequence alignments of syntenic homologous genes in soybean and common bean. A. Original alignment generated by MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). B. Manually modified alignment. Blue boxes indicate modified regions. Sequence divergence All pairwise alignments of the syntenic genes were prepared into the required format by the PAML software using Perl or Python programming in order to calculate non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution using the yn00 and baseml modules with the default parameters except model was set to 1 instead of 0 (Yang, 2007). Please refer to the manual for more information about running programs in the PAML package. Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic trees are used to tell the phylogenetic relationship among homologous genes. Sequence Alignment The nucleotide sequences or protein sequences of the syntenic genes were aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004) or ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) using default parameters. muscle -in input -out output or clustalw input Phylogenetic Tree Construction The sequence alignments of the homologous genes were transferred to MEGA software to construct the phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining maximum composite likelihood model integrated for nucleotide sequences and Poisson correction for protein sequences with pairwise deletions (Kumar et al., 2018). Bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 replicates.. Gene duplication, including whole genome duplication or polyploidy, segmental duplication, and tandem duplication, is a very important process that increases gene copy number and thus enhances genetic diversity in many organisms. Because of this, gene duplication is thought to be a major force in evolution (Ohno, 1970; Otto and Whitton, 2000; Blanc and Wolfe, 2004; Jiao et al., 2011). After duplication, duplicated genes are subject to a variety of changes, such as accumulation of point mutations, insertions and deletions, gene conversion and transposon insertions (Ilic et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2005; Sémon and Wolfe, 2007). Theoretically, two or multiple copies of the duplicated genes have undergone different levels of selective constraint, which makes the functional divergence of the duplicated genes. This can be reflected on the sequence divergence of the homologous genes, such as non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and synonymous substitution (Ks), the latter of which the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Because it is neutral with respect to selection, Ks can be used to determine rough divergence time. The ratio of Ka/Ks can be used to estimate the selection pressure on genes. A Ka/Ks ratio equal to one indicates a lack of selection, as is observed in pseudogenes. The ratio of Ka/Ks higher and lower than one implies positive and purifying selection, respectively. The values of Ka/Ks for the vast majority of genes are < 1.0 due to purifying selection to maintain function (Makalowski and Boguski, 1998; Nekrutenko et al., 2002). When comparing duplicate genes, differences in Ka/Ks suggest different levels or kinds of selection. In order to determine the evolutionary distance, we first need to identify the homologous genes within or between different species. Here, we will mainly focus on the homologous genes that show syntenic relationships between different species. Syntenic genes are those genes that retain an ancestral position on a given region of a chromosome. We refer to these syntenic homologous genes as “syntelogs” (Zhao et al., 2017). The advantage of focusing on syntelogs is that if they are the result of polyploidy, all syntelogs arose at the same time, so groups of syntenic gene pairs can be compared with high confidence. Here, we describe a detailed pipeline for the identification and comparison of the evolutionary distance of syntelogs by using soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) as example species (Figure 1). It has been proposed that soybean has experienced a recent whole genome duplication event roughly 5 to 13 million years ago (MYA, Schmutz et al., 2010), occurring after the split with its close relative common bean roughly 19 MYA (Lavin et al., 2005; McClean et al., 2010). In this protocol, we will estimate the evolutionary divergence of the duplicated gene pairs in soybean by comparing them with the orthologous genes in the common bean genome."

        "@value": "Flow Cytometric Analysis of Autophagic Activity with Cyto-ID Staining in Primary Cells. Flow cytometry allows very sensitive and reliable high-throughput analysis of autophagic flux. This methodology permits to screen cells in flow and capture multi-component images. Using this technology autophagic flux may be analysed accurately in both suspension as well as adherent cells upon trypsinization independent of how heterogeneous the autophagosomal content might be. The method is based on Cyto-ID staining of autophagic compartments (pre-autophagosomes, autophagosomes, and autophagolysosomes) in live cells using Cyto-ID® Autophagy Detection Kit. Autophagic compartments are intermediate constituents of a dynamic lysosomal degradation process and their intracellular abundance at a particular time point is a function of the established equilibrium between their generation and degradation. Determination of autophagic flux facilitates the discrimination between early induction of autophagosome formation and late inhibition of autophagosome maturation as both results in an ultimate increase in autophagosomal presence. Cyto-ID assay is based on the usage of a specific dye that selectively stains autophagic compartments and therefore allows determination of autophagic flux as accumulation of stained compartments in basic or activated conditions [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L) or Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 6 mmol/L glucose (starvation medium)] after blockage of autophagolysosomal degradation using lysosomotropic compounds such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10-20 mmol/L) or chloroquine (CQ) (5-10 µmol/L). ΔMFI Cyto-ID = MFI Cyto-ID (+CQ/NH4Cl) - MFI Cyto-ID (-CQ/NH4Cl).. Maintain cells under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Keep cell density below 1 x 106/ml. Caution: Prior to analysis cell should be kept for several hours (min 12 h) in fresh medium to avoid potential activation of autophagy due to nutrients exhaustion. Generally culture medium contains autophagy affecting substances: amino acids, glucose, growth factors, hormones etc. Take care when comparing autophagic flux in different conditions to normalize for all the necessary factors. Normalize also for the solvent used when analysing the effect of different substances on autophagy – for example DMSO, ethanol etc. might affect autopagic flux. Incubate the cells for the desired time and under the conditions of interest. Negative control subjected to vehicle treatment should be included. Caution: When analysing prolonged periods of time and/or under conditions potentially affecting cells numbers or viability, differences in nutrient consumption and therefore abundance might occur and influence your results as autophagic activity is highly related to the nutritional status. Positive control [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L), Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 6 mmol/L glucose (starvation medium)] and negative control [3-methyladenine (3-MA) (3-10 mmol/L), wortmannin (30-100 nmol/L), LY294002 (7-20 µmol/L), nocodazole (12-50 µmol/L), vinblastine (12-50 µmol/L), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10-20 mmol/L), hydrohychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) (5-10 µmol/L)] may be also included. Upon completion of treatment period, wash the cells with DPBS. For suspension cells use centrifugation, for adherent cells wash as they are adherent (do not trypsinize). Resuspend suspension cells, or add to adherent cells Cyto-ID Green containing indicator free cell culture medium, containing 5% FBS. Suggested cell density for staining stage is 105 to 106 cells/ml. Suggested Cyto-ID Green concentration is 1 μl of Cyto-ID Green Detection Reagent in 1 ml cell culture medium. Mix well and incubate for 30 min under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 in the dark. At the end of staining procedure, wash away the Cyto-ID containing medium. Wash once more with DPBS and resuspend suspension cells or trypsinize, wash and resuspend adherent cells in ice cold DPBS containing 2% FBS. Note: Caution upon completion of staining step whenever possible keep always on ice and in the dark. Analyze samples using flow cytometer and plot data of cell counts as FITC (FL1) fluorescence intensity. Table 1 may be used to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Table 1. Analysis of unknown substance X X plus Medium Activator I → ↑↑ II ↑↑ ↑↑↑ III ↓↓ ↓ or ↑ Notes: →↑↓: ΔMFI Cyto-ID = MFI Cyto-ID (+CQ/NH4Cl) - MFI Cyto-ID (-CQ/NH4Cl). CQ/NH4Cl stays for either CQ or NH4Cl. Caution: The calculation of ΔMFI Cyto-ID requires both +CQ/NH4Cl and -CQ/NH4Cl condition for each individual sample! Suggested incubation with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10–20 mmol/L) or chloroquine (CQ) (5–10 µmol/L) is 5 h. (Activator): autophagy induction [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L) or starvation medium]. Suggested incubation 5 h. (Caution: The concentration of the activator should be established for the particular cell type.) Analysis of unknown substance X should include co incubation with one or more activators. Table 1 illustrates three possible scenarios. a) Scenario (I) unknown substance X does not impact cellular autophagic activity; b) Scenario (II) X is an activator; c) Scenario (III) X is an inhibitor of autophagy. Caution: Although considered the most accurate sensitive and reliable method for analysis of autophygic flux, flow cytometry determination of Cyto-ID stained cells should be combined with alternative methods with non overlapping limitations such as electron microscopy (EM) fluorescence microscopy (FM), western blotting (WB) etc. Example data: Figure 1. Flow cytometry analysis of autophagic flux in BMDC incubated with autophagy inhibitor 3MA (10 mM) for 10 h in the presence or absence of autophagy activator PP242 for the last 5 h (left) with representative histograms (right)."

        "@value": "c-Fos and Arc Immunohistochemistry on Rat Cerebellum. This protocol aims to introduce methods for sacrificing rats by transcardial perfusion and extracting the brain, and introduce methods for staining the rat brain tissue with c-Fos and Arc antibodies. Please note the expression of the proteins is very sensitive to behavioral paradigm that triggers neural activity.. Perfusion To prepare solution, please refer to recipes. Let the solution flow by gravity (e.g. hanging bottles on top of the fume hood). About 250 ml/ rat is required. Prepare all equipment needed (scissors, forceps, clippers to hold hands/feet…etc). Note: Better to work close to the water tab (for rinsing out the coagulated blood during perfusion). Anesthetize the animal (overdosed with pentobarbital, 0.5 ml-1 ml/rat depending on weight) at least 30 min after behavioral treatment (this time allows protein synthesis). Pinch the toes to check the animal is fully asleep. Locate the sternum and poke into it using a scissor. Cut the chest cavity in V shape above the liver. Hold the sternum with a clip, and flip over the head to open the rib cage. *(optional) pinching the aorta behind the liver will help blood circulation into the brain. After pinching the aorta, let the forelimbs/hindlimbs relax (if clamped). Insert a cannula connected to the solution bottle into the apex of the heart near the left ventricle. Hold the cannula so that it is slightly pointing towards the right atrium. Start the saline flow. Immediately, cut (~0.3 cm) the right atrium. Rinse as necessary to remove the coagulated blood. You can try scraping out the debris using a forcep. Once the solution turns transparent (no more red blood cells), let the PFA flow (if you need immediate fixation, fix with PFA. No need to wait for the solution turning transparent). Leave until the solution is used up (could be longer than 20 min depending on the flow rate, weight…etc). If you see solution drops coming out of nostrils, it is a good sign. Extract the brain out of the skull carefully. Prepare a vial (tube) for each brain filled with cryoprotectant (solution 6). Store until the brain sinks to the bottom. Replacing the solution every day or so is recommended. For longer storage, embed in the OCT compound and store at -80 °C until use. Note: If you choose to cut the coronal sections using cryostat: Cut the tissue at 30 μm (could be in the range of 25-50 μm). Free-floating method: collect the sections in 24 well. Store in PBS (pH 7.4, 0.1 M) under 4 °C. Work immediately, if possible. Otherwise, store in cryoprotectant (solution 6) under -20 °C. Immunohistochemistry (IHC, Free-floating method) Note: If sections are mounted onto a slide immediately after cut, about 0.3 ml working solution is needed per slide. This method will help you save some antibodies. The disadvantage is that antibody may not be penetrating the tissue as effectively as in free-floating method. Also, slides might be easily dried out. For free-floating method, ~0.5 ml is required per well. For 30 μM-thick sections, about 7-8 sections can undergo identical treatment within a well. Use a dropper with a very thin tip to drain out solutions. Make sure the sections are not damaged during washing/solution change. Start with washing in PBS (3 times, 5 min each). Block the tissue with normal donkey serum containing 0.25% Triton-100. 1 h at room temperature (RT). Prepare primary antibody in the blocking solution. *Vortex briefly for diluting an antibody. Primary antibody incubation carried out over night at 4 °C. Wrapping the well with parafilm will prevent dehydration. For immediate results, one could incubate at RT for ~2-3 h. Overnight incubation is recommended for sufficient antibody incubation. Take the well out of refrigerator and let it sit at RT for ~1 h. Wash with PBS (3 times, 5 min each). Secondary antibody incubation under RT 1-2 h. Following incubation, wash with PB (NOT PBS!) for 3 times, 5 min each. Mount the sections carefully onto slides. Air dry while covered on top (with tinfoil, or any type of lid that prevents light). Apply a drop of Vectashield (Vector laboratory) before coverslipping. For storage, keep at -80 °C.."

        "@value": "SarkoSpin: A Technique for Biochemical Isolation and Characterization of Pathological TDP-43 Aggregates. TDP-43 is the main aggregating protein in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Aggregated TDP-43 is resistant to diverse detergent solubilization, yet physiological TDP-43 and other abundant proteins commonly co-purify with pathological TDP-43. This mixed isolation has precluded the elucidation of the biochemical and structural features of the pathological TDP-43 and its role in disease. Here we describe SarkoSpin, a method for the isolation of pure pathological TDP-43 from patient autopsy brain by sample solubilization with Sarkosyl after nuclease treatment. This purification, which is also applicable to cell culture material, permits the study of biochemical properties of exclusively pathological TDP-43, allowing for the first time the determination of their link to the clinical presentation of FTLD. This method opens up a path for the study of pathological TDP-43 at the molecular and structural level in the heterogeneous spectrum of ALS and FTLD cases.. Homogenization of tissue (Figure 1A) Figure 1. Schematic representation of the SarkoSpin protocol. A. Brain autopsy tissue is mechanically homogenized and divided into single-use aliquots, which are snap-frozen for future uses. B. Aliquoted homogenates are solubilized in a sarkosyl-based buffer and treated with nuclease in order to disrupt major protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes, before C. the bulk of insoluble pathological TDP-43 can be isolated in a single spin. (D, E) Alternatively, the biochemical properties of the insoluble pathological TDP-43 can be analyzed by different analytical centrifugation methods. Take the patient samples out of the -80 °C freezer into a box containing dry ice to avoid thawing of the tissue while processing. Place the brain sample on the balance over a paper and let it thaw slightly. Cut a piece with a maximum weight of 300 mg from the brain sample with a sterile scalpel and autoclaved forceps. Return the remainder of the sample into dry ice to avoid further thawing and damage of the tissue. Chop the brain sample on the balance into smaller portions with the sterile scalpel. For homogenization, transfer the tissue pieces into the 2 ml-tube from the lysing kit, containing a mixture of ceramic beads with a diameter of 1.4 and 2.8 mm. Add HS buffer in a ratio of 5:1 to the amount of tissue. For example, for the maximum of 300 mg per tube, add 1.5 ml 1x HS buffer (Recipe 2). Homogenize the samples in a Minilys device three times for 30 s each at maximum speed. Cool down the sample on ice between rounds. Let the sample set down for the froth to disappear. A short spin of the tube in a table-top microfuge will help. Vortex quickly at low speed while avoiding creating new froth. Divide the homogenate into aliquots of 150 µl in low protein binding 1.5 ml tubes. Keep 10 µl aliquot from the original homogenate to check levels of phosphorylated TDP-43 in the sample by Western blot and 5 µl for protein concentration determination (directly add to 45 µl 1x HS buffer to dilute it). This step will allow determining whether homogenates indeed have comparable starting protein concentrations, and therefore SarkoSpin the on homogenates from different brain samples will be comparable. Snap-freeze the 150 µl aliquots on dry ice and store at -80 °C. Homogenate aliquots are good for SarkoSpin purification for months to years if properly stored at -80 °C. Solubilization (Figure 1B) Thaw the homogenate aliquots (from Step A13) on ice. Add 50 µl of Benzonase mix (Recipe 3) to each sample. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 200 µl of 2x HS buffer 4% Sarkosyl (Recipe 4) to each sample. Incubate in a Thermo Mixer at 38 °C and shaking at 600 rpm for 45 min. When performing SarkoSpin from cultured cell samples, cell lysis and solubilization are performed in a combined step as follows: Per well of a 6-well plate, lyse cells in 100 µl 1x HS buffer 0.5% Sarkosyl. Add 5 µl of Benzonase mix for cells (Recipe 3). Incubate for 5 min at RT. Scrape the cells and transfer the lysate to a low protein binding 1.5 ml tube. Wash the well with additional 100 µl of 1x HS buffer 0.5% Sarkosyl and transfer to the tube. Vortex to homogenize. Transfer 170 µl of the lysate into a new low protein binding 1.5 ml tube, leaving 5 µl for protein concentration determination and 30 µl for Western blot analysis of total lysate. Add 178 µl 2x HS 4% Sarkosyl and 1x HS to 170 µl of lysate, for a final concentration of 2% Sarkosyl in a volume of 400 µl (like for brain homogenates solubilization). Incubate on ice for 45 min, vortexing in intervals of 10 min. Proceed with the rest of the protocol as for the brain homogenates. Isolation (Figure 1C) Add 200 µl of ice-cold 1x HS buffer 0.5% Sarkosyl (Recipe 5) to each sample. Centrifuge at 21,200 x g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in a bench top centrifuge. Label low protein binding 1.5 ml tubes with the sample name and “Supernatant/“Pellet”. After the centrifugation, remove up to 500 µl of the supernatant and keep it aside in the tube pre-labeled as “Supernatant”. Carefully remove the remaining supernatant with a gel-loading tip and discard. Let the sample stand for one minute and repeat Step C5 to ensure that all supernatant is removed. Carefully wash the pellet (brown) and tube walls with 100 µl cell culture grade PBS. Lipids can appear as a white layer above the protein pellet and can be carefully washed away with the PBS (for complete removal of lipids in the sample, see below). Remove all traces of PBS by repeating Steps C5 and C6. Resuspend the pellet in the desired amount of 1x HS buffer 0.5% Sarkosyl and transfer to the tube pre-labeled as “Pellet”. If samples are not going to be immediately used for analysis, do not resuspend in the pellet. Snap-freeze the samples on dry ice and store at -80 °C. Proceed to pellet analysis by SDS-PAGE, native PAGE or dot blot and Western blot (Data analysis, Figure 2). Figure 2. Representative Western blots of the supernatant and pellet fractions from SarkoSpin isolation. Pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 is enriched in the pellet fraction of samples from FTLD patients but not in healthy controls, while the bulk of the physiological TDP-43 remains soluble. Importantly, abundant cellular proteins such as SOD1, actin and histone H3 also remain in the supernatant fraction. In order to avoid co-precipitation of lipids and proteins, SarkoSpin can alternatively be performed over a cushion of sucrose as follows (continues from Step B5): Lay 400 µl of solubilized homogenates over 400 µl of sucrose cushion (Recipe 7) in low protein binding 1.5 ml tubes. Centrifuge at 21,200 x g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in a bench top centrifuge. Proceed with the protocol as described from Step C3 on. Velocity sedimentation assay (Figure 1D, continues from Step B5) Prepare the OptiPrep gradient cushions as indicated in Table 1. Table 1. Recipe for the OptiPrep gradient cushions required for the velocity sedimentation assay. For 2x HS buffer 1% Sarkosyl, see Recipe 9. For the commercial OptiPrep solution (60%), see Materials and Reagents. Use a Gradient Master to prepare the linear OptiPrep gradient in 4.2 ml SW60 rotor tubes as follows: With the tube in the marker block for an SW 60 Ti rotor, draw a line at the middle of the tube for short caps. Pipette the 10% OptiPrep cushion into the tube until a few mm above the drawn line. Carefully inject the 25% OptiPrep cushion at the bottom of the tube with the provided steel cannula, thereby pushing the previous 10% OptiPrep cushion up, until the interface reaches the mid-tube mark. Close the tube with the provided short cap, removing the remaining air inside. Use the scroll and spirit level on the Gradient Master in order to make the Magnabase horizontal. Place the tubes in the Magnabase, and transfer onto the Gradient Master plate. Run the program: SW60-1 step://1 min 10 s//82º //20 rpm//. Once finished, carefully remove the tube caps and remove approximately 150 µl of the upper layer of the gradient. Weigh the tubes containing the gradients and balance them as precisely as possible (to the decigram level). Carefully lay 200 µl of the solubilized homogenate (Step B5) over the top of the gradient. Ultracentrifuge at 400,000 x g for 45 min at 4 °C with maximum acceleration and deceleration. Carefully remove the tubes from the centrifuge buckets with tweezers and keep them at 4 °C before fractionation with a piston fractionator associated with a fraction collector. Insert a divisible 250 µl PCR in the collector holder. Rinse the piston before and after each gradient by fractionating of a tube filled with water and using the “rinse” button. Air dry the piston after the washing steps by opening the air screw and pressing the button Air to make it blow through the piston. Screw it back gently after drying. Place the gradient to fractionate in the tube holder, clipped with the cap. Let the piston go down with the position roll until the liquid reaches the collector head. Reset position and enter the program the following program: Speed: 0.5/Distance: 2.96/Number: 16 Press Start. The fractionator will automatically fractionate the gradient into 16 fractions in the divisible 96-well PCR plate. Repeat the washing and drying (Steps D7 and D8) before fractionating another gradient. Density flotation assay (Figure 1E, continues from Step B5) Prepare the OptiPrep gradient cushions as indicated in Table 2. Table 2. Recipe for the OptiPrep gradient cushions required for the density flotation assay. For 8x HS buffer 4% Sarkosyl, see Recipe 8. For the OptiPrep solution (60%), see Materials and Reagents. In order to prepare the discontinuous OptiPrep gradient, carefully lay the OptiPrep cushions in 4.2 ml SW60 rotor tubes to create the discontinuous gradient in the following order (highest concentration at the bottom): 300 μl of pure (60%) OptiPrep solution 700 μl of the 50% OptiPrep cushion 800 μl of the mix (220 μl of solubilized homogenate from step B5 + 680 μl 50% OptiPrep cushion) for a final OptiPrep concentration of 40% 800 μl of the 30% OptiPrep cushion 800 μl of the 20% OptiPrep cushion 800 μl of the 10% OptiPrep cushion Weigh the tubes after pipetting each cushion to balance them to the decigram level. Ultracentrifuge at 125,000 x g for 17 h at 4 °C with maximum acceleration and deceleration. Fractionate as describe from Step D5.. Protein aggregation in affected neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (Soto et al., 2003). In two of the most devastating forms, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the principal aggregating protein is TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) (Ling et al., 2013). Under pathological conditions, TDP-43 is abnormally ubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved, and is sequestered in insoluble cytoplasmic inclusions that include both the full-length protein as well as its highly-aggregation prone C-terminal fragment (Neumann et al., 2006; Arai et al., 2006). TDP-43 inclusions account for virtually all ALS patients and for up to 45% of FTLD patients, suggesting that ALS and FTLD are the two ends of a single clinical, genetic and pathological spectrum (Ling et al., 2013). FTLD cases can be subdivided into at least three subtypes (A, B and C) based on the shape and location of the aggregated TDP-43 (Lee et al., 2017), and it was recently shown that different biochemical features of the pathological TDP-43 may underlie this heterogeneity (Laferriere et al., 2019).An RNA-binding protein (Buratti et al., 2001), TDP-43 forms physiological oligomers that are required to perform its indispensable role in RNA splicing regulation (Afroz et al., 2017). Pathological TDP-43 becomes resistant to solubilization by a wide range of detergents, but its isolation from physiological TDP-43 in brain tissue is hindered by protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the lysate. TDP-43 and other RNA-binding proteins containing low complexity domains may form homo- and heterooligomeric species in complex with nucleic acids that become partially insoluble. Here, we describe SarkoSpin, a purification assay for the isolation of pathological TDP-43 from patient brain tissue by utilizing a single-step solubilization with nuclease treatment (Laferriere et al., 2019). This technique allows for the isolation of pure pathological TDP-43 from 99.8% of the total protein mass, including proteins that form big complexes in their physiological state, such as actin or histones. Isolated TDP-43 is pathologically modified and becomes polyubiquitination, hyperphosphorylated and C-terminally cleaved. Importantly, purified TDP-43 is free from the presence of other RNA-binding proteins containing low-complexity domains, such as hnRNPA1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1), hnRNPH (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H), FUS (fused in sarcoma) or SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), which are also associated with ALS and FTLD. The isolation of pure fractions of pathological TDP-43 in combination with other high-resolution techniques will represent a major advancement in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms and structural differences of TDP-43 underlying ALS and FTLD heterogeneity."

        "@value": "Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Isolation and Culture from Mouse Aorta. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the ascending thoracic aorta arise from neural crest cells, whereas SMCs in the descending aorta are derived from the presomitic mesoderm. SMCs play important roles in cardiovascular development and aortic aneurysm formation. This protocol describes the detailed process for explanting ascending and descending SMCs from mouse aortic tissue. Conditions for maintenance and subculture of isolated SMCs and characterization of the vascular SMC phenotype are also described.. Preparation of reagents To make aorta biopsy storage media, add the following to the bottle of 500 ml. Waymouth’s MB 752/1 medium. 5 ml of antibiotic/antimycotic 6.25 ml of L-glutamine 15 ml of sodium bicarbonate 5 ml of MEM non-essential amino acids 5 ml of HEPES buffer Note: Please note that we do not remove any of the basal media to compensate for the addition of the additives. The final volume of aorta biopsy storage media will therefore be 536.25 ml. The media can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months or until the expiration date from the manufacturer on the bottle, whichever is sooner. Preparation of avertin solution Add 15.5 ml tert-amyl alcohol to 25 g avertin (2-2-2-tribromoethanol) and stir the solution on a magnetic stirrer until avertin is completely dissolved. This will probably take overnight. The stock should be stored in a dark bottle at room temperature and capped tightly. Combine 0.5 ml avertin stock and 39.5 ml normal saline or PBS in a 50 ml graduated cylinder. Drop in magnetic stir bar, seal graduate cylinder with Parafilm and completely wrap cylinder with aluminum foil to exclude all light. Stir overnight to dissolve. Filter the working solution through 0.2 micron filter into a dark bottle. Keep working solution at 4 °C. Stock and working solution containers will be properly labeled (name, date made, concentration and initials of lab member). Stock solution should be discarded after four months, and working solution should be discarded after 2 weeks. All solutions should not be used if a precipitate or discoloration is detected. To make complete smooth muscle media (SmBm complete), filter the following through a 0.22 µm vacuum filter and add to a bottle of 500 ml SmBm basal media from Lonza. This media can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months or until the expiration date from the manufacturer on the bottle, whichever is sooner. It is important to note that the aliquot of gentamicin contained in the SmBm bullet kit should not be added. 100 ml FBS Aliquot of FGF contained in the bullet kit (1 ml). Aliquot of EGF contained in the bullet kit (0.5 ml). Aliquot of insulin contained in the bullet kit (0.5 ml). 5 ml of antibiotic/antimycotic Note: We do not remove any of the basal media to compensate for the addition of the additives. The final volume of SmBm complete will therefore be 607 ml. Preparation of digestive enzymes and other reagents Thaw and filter one 500 ml bottle of FBS and store at 4 °C in 50 ml aliquots. To make smooth muscle cell freeze media, combine 45 ml of SmBm complete with 5 ml filtered FBS and 5 ml sterile DMSO. Collagenase type 1 is received as a powder. The final concentration needed for a 3-4 h digestion is 1.00 mg/ml. To prepare the stock solution, add 2.5 ml aorta biopsy storage media to re-suspend the 50 mg collagenase. Mix well. Make 500 µl aliquots and store at -20 °C. Soybean trypsin inhibitor is received as a powder. The final concentration needed for a 3-4 h digestion is 0.25 mg/ml. To prepare the stock solution, take 2.5 mg and dissolve in 10 ml aorta biopsy storage media, then make 10 aliquots, 1 ml/aliquots Elastase type 1 is received as a liquid. The bottle can be stored at 4 °C. Do not aliquot as the reagent is not stable when aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. The final concentration needed for a 3-4 h digestion is 0.1875 mg/ml. Dissection of the mouse to remove aortic tissue Anesthetize the experimental mice (3-6 mice/explant) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection with 2.5% avertin. Use 0.5 ml of solution for each mouse. To determine when anesthesia is effective, pinch the toe of the mouse hard between your nails. If the mouse kicks or reacts at all, the anesthesia is incomplete. Wait a couple of additional minutes and test again until there is no response to the toe pinch. If anesthesia is still incomplete after 5-7 min you can dose the mouse again with an additional 0.3 ml of avertin. Place the mouse under a light source for dissection. Cut the skin of the mouse from the abdomen to the top of the thorax. Lift the sternum with tweezers and cut the diaphragm. Then cut away the lower part of the ribcage to expose the heart, remove the lungs and thymus, and cut away the esophagus, expose the aorta running along the spine. See Figure 1 and Video 1. Figure 1. Mouse thoracic cavity. Picture shows the mouse after chest has been opened. Blue indicates the lung tissue and green the thymus tissue which must both be removed to give better access to the heart and aorta. Video 1. Opening of mouse thoracic cavity and removal of tissues. This video shows the first part of the dissection from the opening of the mouse thoracic cavity to the removal of the lungs and trachea. Place the mouse under a dissecting microscope. Remove the remaining tissues and use microdissection scissors or forceps to remove all of the fat around the top of the heart, the ascending aorta, and its branches. See Figure 2. Figure 2. Exposed heart and descending aorta in a mouse. Picture shows the mouse after chest has been opened and lungs, thymus, and other tissues have been removed. The red arrow indicates the heart, which should be pulled up slightly to expose the ascending aorta and carotid branches. The red arrowhead indicated the descending aorta which should be clipped below the diaphragm. Gently pull up on the heart with forceps, without breaking the ascending aorta. Use forceps or scissors to gently separate the descending aorta from the spine. Clip the descending aorta just below the diaphragm. Clip the carotid arteries to release the ascending aorta. See Video 2. Put the heart, ascending, and descending aortas which are all connected in a 60 mm dish with sterile DPBS. Video 2. Removal of mouse heart and aorta. This video shows the second part of the dissection: removing the heart and aorta. Place the dish under the dissecting microscope and remove any fatty or connective tissues from the ascending and descending aorta. See Figure 3. Separate the ascending and descending aorta by making a cut just distal to the origin of the left common carotid artery. Put ascending and descending aorta separately in new dishes with DPBS labeled according to the region of the aorta and the genotype of the mouse. Working quickly but carefully, repeat for each experimental mouse until all the tissue has been separated. Pool ascending aortas and descending aortas for each explant. Move all the dishes with aortic tissue to the tissue culture hood. Figure 3. Appearance of the dissected aorta. Whole mount image showing the aortic tissue after it has been removed from the mouse and completely cleaned. Ascending aorta is marked by a red arrow. Explanting of the tissue Note: Please note that all steps for the rest of the protocol should be carried out under a tissue culture hood using standard sterile tissue culture techniques. Prepare the enzyme mix Thaw one aliquot each of collagenase and trypsin inhibitor at 4 °C before beginning the dissection of the mice. For each explant, use 5 ml of aorta biopsy storage media. If you are doing a 3-4 h digestion during the day, add 250 µl collagenase, 100 µl trypsin inhibitor, and 324 µl* elastase for each 5 ml of aorta biopsy storage media. For an overnight (15-18 h) digestion, use 1:10 dilution so 25 µl collagenase, 10 µl trypsin inhibitor, and 32.4 µl* elastase. *Note: The amount of elastase to add was calculated based on the mass and volume of the bottle. If you order elastase from a different source, you will need to recalculate the amount of this enzyme to add. Pour 70% ethanol, DPBS, and aorta biopsy storage media into three separate 60 mm tissue culture dishes. Using forceps, take each isolated aorta from its storage tube and wash the piece of tissue in ethanol, then DPBS, then biopsy media. Do not leave the tissue in ethanol for more than about 10-15 sec, though leaving it in DPBS or media for longer is OK. Place each piece of tissue into the lid of a 60 mm tissue culture dish. Using a scalpel and forceps, cut tissue into small pieces-make sure to cut the tissue both circumferentially and longitudinally to increase the surface area exposed to the digestion mix. The pieces will be variable in size, but the average size should be 1-2 mm in diameter. Place the chopped up tissue pieces into a new 60 mm tissue culture dish containing the 5 ml of media plus digestive enzyme mix made up in step C1. Label the dish. Place dish into incubator (37 °C). If doing a 3-4 h digestion, check at 2 h and every 30 min thereafter. If doing an overnight digestion, leave overnight, check at 15 h and every hour thereafter. When the tissue looks mostly digested with several floating single cells, but still some large clumps of tissue, pipet up and down tissue and media 5-10 times using a 10 ml pipet to help release cells from tissue. Place back into incubator for 30 more minutes. Also, remove filtered FBS from fridge to warm up to room temperature and place complete SmBM media into water bath to warm up to 37 °C. At the end of incubation time, look at tissue under microscope to make sure that the cells are free from the tissue. See Figure 4. If the tissue has been well digested (there should still be some intact pieces of tissue), add 2.5 ml of Serum and pipet up and down ~5 times. Next add 2.5 ml of complete SmBM media and pipet up and down ~5 times. Figure 4. Appearance of the digested tissue. Photo of the dish after digestion, with some ‘net-like’ tissue floating in it (black arrow) but a majority of tissue pieces digested. Transfer the entire contents of the tissue culture dish (should be 10 ml total) into one 15 ml tube. Spin down at 180 x g (about 700 rpm in a Sorvall Legend T+ tabletop centrifuge) at room temperature for 5 min. Carefully check to see if there is any floating tissue piece in the tube. If so, use a 200 µl pipette to remove the tissue piece and place it directly into a labeled T25 flask with complete SmBm. Once there are no tissue pieces floating, remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of complete SmBM media. Note: If the supernatant was cloudy, repeat steps C10 and C11 until the supernatant is clear. If the supernatant was clear, proceed to step C12. Transfer the 5 ml complete SmBm with resuspended cells to a labeled T25 flask. Place flask in incubator. Allow cells to settle and adhere to the flask. Don’t change media for at least 48 h. If cells still haven’t settled down at this point, don’t remove any media and add 2 ml of media to the flask. Let the cells settle for another 1 to 2 days. Maintenance and subculture of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells. Once SMCs grow up, feed the cells with fresh media every 3-4 days. Prewarm the SmBm complete media bottle in a 37 °C water bath for at least 15 min prior to feeding cells. Aspirate media from each flask and discard. Add 5 ml of media for each T25 flask without disturbing the cell layer. Return flasks to the incubator. When the cells reach about 70% confluent, or when some areas start to get very tightly packed and almost overgrown, the cells are ready to split. See Figure 5. Passage the SMCs from one T25 flask to one T75 flask. Prewarm the SmBm complete media bottle in a 37 °C water bath and allow the TrypLE Express reagent to equilibrate at room temperature for at least 15 min prior to splitting cells. Aspirate media from each flask and discard. Wash each flask once with 4 ml of DPBS, allow it to cover the cell layer, then aspirate and discard the DPBS. Add 1 ml TrypLE Express reagent to each flask. Make sure the trypsin is evenly covering the bottom of the flask/cell layer. Place the flask in the 37 °C incubator for 3 min. Confirm digestion under microscope. If most cells are round, bang the flask twice on both sides. If most cells are still attached, incubate at room temperature for 1 min and then confirm digestion and bang the flasks twice on both sides. Add 4 ml of SmBm complete to each flask to neutralize the trypsin enzyme. Pipet up and down to detach all the cells and completely neutralize the enzyme. Transfer all 5 ml of liquid plus cells to a 15 ml conical tube. Spin down 5 min at 180 x g in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature. Aspirate supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml of SmBm complete, and transfer all 10 ml to a labeled T75 flask. Mark the date of split and the passage number (P1 for this first passaging). Figure 5. Appearance of confluent SMCs. The left picture shows a 100% confluent field of smooth muscle cells. These cells need to be passaged within 24 h. The right panel shows smooth muscle cells around 70% confluent. Note the spindle-shaped morphology which is characteristic of SMC cultures. When the SMCs have expanded, the cell aliquots can be frozen. Follow steps D2a-D2i in the above protocol for passaging SMCs. One T75 flask can be split into 2 frozen cell aliquots. A confluent T75 flask should have around 2 million cells, so each freeze vial will have around 1 million cells. After spinning down, follow the below steps to freeze cells. Aspirate supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in 3 ml SMC freeze media (see Recipes). Transfer 1.5 ml of the freeze media with dissolved pellet to each of two cryovials. Cryovials should be labeled with the passage number, date of freezing, and cell line. Place cryovials into a slow freeze container (either a foam container or an isopropanol based container will work) and freeze in the -80 °C freezer overnight. Transfer the frozen aliquots to a liquid nitrogen storage system for long-term storage. When you want to thaw your SMC aliquots, a vial of frozen cells can typically be thawed to one T75 flask. Prewarm SmBm complete media in the 37 °C water bath for at least 15 min prior to removing cells. Retrieve the cell vial from the liquid nitrogen freezer. Warm quickly by placing the cryovials in the 37 °C water bath for about 1-2 min. Add 8 ml of SmBm complete to a 15 ml conical tube. Then transfer the 1.5 ml of thawed cells into the same conical tube. Spin down for 5 min at 180 x g in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature. Remove and discard supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of SmBm complete and transfer to a T75 flask.. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) make up the muscular medial layer of arteries. Larger elastic arteries, such as the aorta, have multiple concentric lamellae consisting of aligned smooth muscle cells sandwiched between elastin fibers. The elastin and collagen present within the medial layer of elastic arteries allow it to distribute the force generated by the heart throughout the vessel wall (Wagenseil and Mecham, 2009). Smaller muscular arteries, by contrast, have only an internal and external elastic lamina bounding the smooth muscle layer. These arteries are downstream in the arterial tree and thus bear less force from blood flow.Vascular smooth muscle cells, unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, are capable of modulating their phenotype in response to vascular injury or environmental cues. Under normal physiologic conditions, quiescent, contractile SMCs populate the artery wall and contract to regulate vascular tone and keep blood flow continuous in response to pulsatile pressures. Contractile SMCs are characterized by high expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile genes, including smooth muscle specific α-actin and myosin heavy chain (Owens et al., 2004). However, in response to injury or mitogenic stimuli, SMCs downregulate expression of the contractile genes and take on a synthetic phenotype: they proliferate rapidly, migrate into the site of injury, and remodel the extracellular matrix by synthesizing both matrix-digesting enzymes and new matrix proteins. Many vascular diseases are associated with a synthetic SMC phenotype, including atherosclerosis (Owens, 1995).SMCs located in different areas of the body actually arise from diverse embryonic lineages (Majesky, 2007). For example, the SMCs populating the ascending thoracic aorta and the cerebrovasculature are derived from neural crest cells. However, SMCs in the descending thoracic aorta come from mesodermal origins. These distinctions affect the ultimate properties of the SMCs, so it is important when designing experiments to use SMCs from the same developmental origin where the phenotype of interest arises. In this protocol, we give detailed instructions for isolating and culturing SMCs from the ascending and descending thoracic aortas in the mouse. We have previously used this technique to isolate SMCs from genetically modified mice and their wild-type littermates to provide an in vitro system for looking at the effect of genetic changes on SMC phenotype (Cao et al., 2010; Kuang et al., 2012; Kuang et al., 2016; Papke et al., 2013; Kwartler et al., 2014)."

        "@value": "Harvest and Culture of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages are used as primary macrophages in lots of studies, mainly because they are easy to obtain. Injection of thioglycollate broth i.p. induces inflammatory responses and elicits large numbers of macrophages. This protocol can be used for harvesting resident or thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells. Peritoneal macrophages are non-adherent in situ and when they are cultured in dishes, they become adherent so that macrophages may be separated from other types of cells in peritoneal cavity.. Harvest and culture of resident peritoneal cells Fill 5 ml of PBS with 5 mM EDTA in a 5 ml syringe with a 25 G needle. Anesthetize and sacrifice mouse with CO2. Place mouse with abdomen up on paper towel in hood. Swab abdomen with 70% alcohol or isopropanol. Make a small incision in the center of the skin overlying the peritoneal wall. Note: Small incision is made on the skin to peel the skin off. Injection and extraction can be at different sites on peritoneal membrane. Firmly pull skin to expose the peritoneal wall. Insert the needle to peritoneal membrane; avoid inserting needle into guts or bladder. Inject 5 ml of PBS EDTA into peritoneal cavity. Massage abdomen for approximately 10-15 sec. Withdraw the needle slowly. Change the 25 G needle on the syringe to a 20 G needle. Use one hand to push the fluid to one side of the peritoneum. Using the other hand, insert needle to the side of cavity with plenty of fluid and withdraw the fluid from peritoneum. Avoid fat, gut or mesentery, which may clog the needle. Try to draw as much fluid as possible. Usually, approximately 4 - 4.5 ml fluid can be recovered from one mouse. Remove needle from syringe and dispense contents into a centrifuge tube on ice. Centrifuge peritoneal cells (300 x g; 3 min) and collect cell pellet. Usually about 2-4 million resident peritoneal cells can be recovered from one C57BL/6 mouse using this method and about 50% are peritoneal macrophages. Resuspend cell pellet from one mouse in 1 ml of cRPMI medium, count cells. Culture peritoneal cells in a 12-well plate, 2 million/well in 1 ml cRPMI at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6-18 h. During this time, peritoneal macrophages adhere to the plastic surface. The floating non-macrophages can then be washed away by adding and aspirating 0.5 ml cRPMI medium twice. The adherent macrophages are ready to use. Harvest and culture thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal cells Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages can be harvested and cultured in the same way as described in steps 1-15 with additional steps as shown below. Preparation of 3% thioglycollate medium. Heat a 300 ml flask with an aluminum foil lid (180-200 °C) in a laboratory oven for at least 18 h to get rid of endotoxin. Suspend 6 grams of thioglycollate medium in 200 ml of pyrogen-free water. Autoclave (15 psi/121 °C/15 min). After cooling, aliquot to 15 ml sterile Falcon tubes. Store in a dark place at room temperature for 2 months before using. We have found that thioglycollate medium stored at room temperature for up to 2 years can still be used. Inject 1 ml of aged thioglycollate i.p. per mouse. Wait for 4-5 days, harvest peritoneal cells. About 10 million macrophages can be recovered from one mouse. Note: The study was performed under an IACUC approved protocol (LCID 11E).."

Here, we use internodes/culms, an important organ to provide mechanical support for rice plants, as an experimental sample to explore the method for cell wall composition analysis. The method includes preparation of cell wall residues, sequential extraction of polysaccharides, and measurement of cellulose. The procedure for acetate examination is also described. This method is applicable to determine the composition of individual cell wall polymers and the modifier acetates, and is suitable to identify cell wall relevant mutants based on the advantages in high throughput, precision and repeatability.. Preparation of destarched alcohol-insoluble cell-wall residues (AIR) Pool the whole 2nd internodes (numbered from the top down) of 5-20 rice mature plants. Freeze the fresh samples in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilize them in a freeze dryer (The rice internodes were lyophilized for 48 h to ensure complete dryness). Grind tissues to a particle size no more than 0.15 mm using ball mill and sieve through mesh with a size of 0.15 mm. Weigh approximately 1 g of the ground plant biomass into a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube. Add 30 ml of 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer and leave in a thermomixer comfort set at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 12 h. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min in a basket centrifuge and discard the supernatant. Repeat Steps A5-A6 once. Add 30 ml of the chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) solution, mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer and leave in a shaking incubator for 30 min at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Repeat Steps A8-A9 twice. Add 15 ml of acetone, shake the tube to re-suspend the pellet. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat Steps A11-A12 twice. Let the biomass samples dry in a drying oven at 40 °C without shaking for approximately 16 h. Treat the residues with 100 U α-amylase in 40 ml MES/Tris buffer (pH 8.1) at 97 °C for 35 min, then 60 °C for 1 h. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 30 ml ddH2O three times and with 15 ml acetone twice, with centrifugation (1,500 x g for 10 min) and supernatant removal after each wash. Let the biomass samples dry in an oven at 40 °C for approximately 16 h to get destarched AIR. Analysis of the crystalline cellulose content Weigh 2 mg AIR material in five replicates into 2 ml Sarstedt tubes. Add 250 µl of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to each sample and make ensure no material is splashed up onto the tube walls. Cap tightly and incubate for 90 min at 121 °C in Dri-Block heaters. Cool the heating blocks and samples on ice. Centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 10 min, then transfer the supernatant to a new Sarstedt tube for optional noncellulosic polysaccharides composition analysis (Foster et al., 2010) and keep the pellet for crystalline cellulose assay. Add 1 ml of Updegraff reagent (Acetic acid: itric acid: water, 8:1:2 v/v) to the pellets left over from the Step B5, cap tightly and vortex. Heat in Dri-Block heaters at 100 °C for 30 min. Cool samples on ice. Centrifuge samples at 11,000 x g for 10 min. Discard supernatant ensuring no pellet material is discarded. Wash once with 1 ml water and four times with 1 ml acetone, centrifuge and discard supernatant as done above. Air dry the pellet in the Dri-Block heaters at 35 °C. Add 175 µl 72% Sulfuric acid and incubate at room temperature for 60 min. Add 825 µl ddH2O, vortex and centrifuge samples at 11,000 x g for 5 min. Analyze the glucose content of the supernatant using the anthrone assay in a 96-well flat bottom assay plate. Add 10 µl of sample and 90 µl of ddH2O for a total volume of 100 µl in each sample well. Prepare standards using 1 mg/ml glucose stock (stock at -20 °C). Make 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 µg standards by pipetting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 µl into the appropriate well, adding 100, 98, 96, 94, 92, and 90 µl ddH2O accordingly. Add 200 µl freshly prepared Anthrone Regent. Heat the plate for 30 min at 80 °C with shaking in a thermomixer comfort. Cool to room temperature. Shake the plate thoroughly in a thermomixer comfort and then read absorption at 625 nm within 1 h. Extraction of pectin from cell wall residues Weigh about 6 mg destarched AIR for 5 replicates into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Add 1 ml of 50 mM ammonium formate (pH 4.5) buffer, then add 2 U of endopolygalacturonase M2 and 0.04 U of pectin methyl esterase. Mix and incubate at 37 °C for 16 h with shaking at 300 rpm in a thermomixer comfort. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 min and transfer the pectin-rich supernatants to a new tube. Keep the remains as pectin-free samples. Freeze the supernatants using liquid nitrogen and then lyophilize them in a freeze dryer, finally get the gelatinous pectin. Isolation of the acetyl-xylan from AIR Weigh about 400 mg of destarched AIR into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Add 30 ml 1% ammonium oxalate and incubate at 85 °C for 2 h. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 15 min in a basket centrifuge. Discard the supernatant to remove pectin. Add 30 ml 11% peracetic acid solution, incubate in a water bath at 85 °C for 30 min for delignification. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellets with 30 ml ddH2O three times and with 15 ml acetone once, through centrifugation (1,500 x g for 10 min) and supernatant removal. Let the pellets dry in an oven set at 40 °C for approximately 16 h. Add 30 ml DMSO and then incubate at 70 °C for 12 h to conduct extraction, centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 min, transfer the supernatant to a new glass bottle. Repeat Step D6 with 12 ml DMSO, and combine the supernatants containing the extractives. Filter the extracts through glass microfiber filters. Precipitate the extracts with 5 volume of ethanol: methanol: water solution (7:2:1, pH 3.0) at 4 °C for 12 h. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 15 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellets four times each with 10 ml anhydrous ethanol with centrifugation (1,500 x g for 10 min) and supernatant removal after each wash. Dry the pellets under vacuum in a concentrator at room temperature. Determining the content of acetyl esters Weigh about 1 mg destarched AIRs/pectin/xylan for 5 replicates into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Add 100 µl 1 N sodium hydroxide to tubes and shake for 1 h at 28 °C and 200 rpm to release the bound acetate. Add 100 µl of 1 N hydrogen chloride to neutralize samples. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 10 min, and transfer 10 µl supernatant aliquot to a UV capable 96-well flat bottom assay plate and immediately quantify released acetic acids according to the instruction of Acetic Acid Assay Kit. Add 94 µl of ddH2O to each sample well in the UV capable 96-well flat bottom assay plate. Add 42 µl of freshly prepared mixture of kit-supplied Solutions 1 and 2 (2.5:1, 30 µl + 12 µl each), mix and incubate at 25 °C for 3 min with shaking at 300 rpm in a thermomixer comfort. Read the absorption at 340 nm (A0). Add 12 µl of freshly diluted kit-supplied solution 3 (1:10, v/v, in ddH2O), mix and incubate at 25 °C for 4 min with shaking at 300 rpm in a thermomixer comfort. Read the absorption at 340 nm (A1). Add 12 µl of freshly diluted kit-supplied solution 4 (1:10, v/v, in ddH2O), mix and incubate at 25 °C for 12 min with shaking at 300 rpm in a thermomixer comfort. Read the absorption at 340 nm (A2). At the same time, it is necessary to make a blank control and a standard curve in parallel. To make a standard curve, add 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 µl acetic acid standard (solution 5) equal to 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5 µg, and adjust the volume of ddH2O in Step E5 to 99, 94, 89, 74, 54 µl, respectively.. The plant cell wall represents one of the most complicated cellular structure in nature and is essential for plant growth and adaptations to environments. Besides presenting multiple polysaccharide components and phenolic compounds, acetylation is a prevalent modification on most cell-wall polymers, which alters the physicochemical properties and increases the complexity of cell wall structure. Establishment of the effective analytic platform for cell wall composition is always a challenging task. The previous analytic method often uses alkali to extract cell wall residues, but removes acetate. Recent works have revealed that acetate patterns on xylan determine the folding of this polymer and impact the binding to cellulose or lignin, indicating its importance in cell wall formation and plant growth control (Grantham et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). The method that can simultaneously examine the composition of diverse cell-wall polysaccharides and their acetyl modifications needs to be developed. It becomes realizable as solvent dimethyl sulfoxide has been found extracting xylan without trimming acetyl esters (Goncalves et al., 2008). Rice culms are representative for cell wall composition methodology analysis because this organ is rich of secondary wall-bearing fiber cells and also contains multiple cell types. In addition to abundant materials, acetylation level varies on different wall polymers and during the culm development. By using rice culms as analytic samples, we developed a protocol for cell wall composition and acetyl modification analyses with some changes from the previous method (Foster et al., 2010). This protocol offers a widely used way to examine the composition of diverse cell wall polymers and determine the acetate content in different rice varieties and other crops."
